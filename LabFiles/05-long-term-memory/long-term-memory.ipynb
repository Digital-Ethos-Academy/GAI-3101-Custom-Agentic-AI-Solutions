    "# Implementing Long-Term Memory in LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Learning Outcomes:**\n",
    "> - Understand the concept and mechanisms of Long-Term Memory\n",
    "> - Implement Long-Term Memory in LangGraph\n",
    "> - Extend the implementation to support consolidation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will implement long-term memory in LangGraph. Long-Term memory is a mechanism that allows the model to remember information from the past. This is particularly useful in tasks that require the model to remember information from the past interactions to tailor their responses to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory in Humans\n",
    "\n",
    "In humans, memory has many different components and processes. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Encoding:* Converting information into a form that can be stored in memory.\n",
    "2. *Storage:* Storing information in memory.\n",
    "3. *Recall:* Passively remembering information.\n",
    "4. *Retrieval:* Actively trying to remember information.\n",
    "5. *Forgetting:* The loss of information over time.\n",
    "6. *Consolidation:* Stabilizing and organizing memories over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be creating a chatbot that can remember information from past interactions. The chatbot will be able to selectively remember information that is important and forget information that is not. The chatbot will also be able to consolidate memories to make them more stable and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "stateDiagram\n",
    "    [*] --> Recall\n",
    "    Recall --> ChatBot\n",
    "    ChatBot --> Encode\n",
    "    Encode --> Consolidate\n",
    "    Consolidate --> Chat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",

    "We will start by building the state of our graph. The state will contain the messages from the user and the chatbot. The state will also contain retrieved memories from the long-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `TypedDict` class from the `typing_extensions` module to define the state. This will allow us to specify the types of the state variables.
