    "# Integrating an Observation Tool in an Agent\n",

    "> **Learning Outcomes:**\n",
    "> - Create an observation tool with AutoGen.\n",
    "> - Integrate the observation tool with an agent.\n",
    "> - Understand the AutoGen Agent flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will implement an observation tool that will allow the agent to observe their environment. This tool won't have any affect on the world outside of the agent, but will allow the agent to gather information about that world. This is a useful capacity for an agent to have, as it allows the agent to make more informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AutoGen Framework\n",
    "[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/index.html) is \"a framework for building AI agents and applications\" that is developed by Microsoft. It is designed to be a flexible and extensible framework that can be used to build a wide range of AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with the `autogen-agentchat` component which is designed for building conversational single and multi-agent systems. This component is built on top of the `autogen` framework and provides a simple way to build agents that can communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scenario\n",
    "Our agent will be tasked with converting Wikipedia pages into a timeline. The agent will be able to observe the Wikipedia page and extract the information needed to create the timeline. The agent will then be able to use this information to create a timeline of the events described in the Wikipedia page. If the agent needs additional information, it can perform more observations to gather that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
