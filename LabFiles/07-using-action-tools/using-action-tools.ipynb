    "> - Create an action tool with AutoGen.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will implement an action tool that will allow the agent to take actions in the environment. This tool will allow the agent to interact with the world outside of the agent. This is a useful capacity for an agent to have, as it allows the agent to affect the world in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AutoGen Framework\n",
    "[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/index.html) is \"a framework for building AI agents and applications\" that is developed by Microsoft. It is designed to be a flexible and extensible framework that can be used to build a wide range of AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with the `autogen-agentchat` component which is designed for building conversational single and multi-agent systems. This component is built on top of the `autogen` framework and provides a simple way to build agents that can communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scenario\n",
    "Our agent will be tasked with organizing a directory of files. The agent will be able to create directories and move files between directories. The agent will be able to take these actions based on the observations it makes of the current state of the directory.\n",
    "\n",

    "Most Agentic libraries, including AutoGen, allow tools to be written as functions. These functions are then converted to tools by the library for easy integration with the agent. While the exact method of writing these functions may vary depending on the library, the general process is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes the necessary inputs and returns the desired output.\n",
    "2. Add type hints to the function to specify the types of the inputs and outputs.\n",
    "3. Create a description of the function.\n",
    "\n",
