    "# Writing a Simple Agent in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "> - Understand the basic structure of an agent.\n",
    "> - Implement a simple agent in Python.\n",
    "> - Test the performance of the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Agentic AI is most often developed using libraries such as [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) or [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/). However, it is also possible to create a simple agent using Python. In this notebook, we will create a simple agent that can interact with a basic environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Wumpus World\n",
    "Our agent will be placed in a simple environment called the Wumpus World. This is a classic problem in the field of AI and provides a good starting point for observing how an agent can interact with an environment to achieve a goal but without specific instructions on how to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wumpus World is a cave consisting of rooms connected by passageways. The rooms are arranged in a 4x4 grid. In the cave is a **Wumpus** that eats any agents which enter the room. The agent can feel a **stench** in the room if the Wumpus is in a neighboring room.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cave also contains **pits**. If an agent enters a room with a pit, it falls in and dies. The agent can feel a **breeze** in the room if there is a pit in a neighboring room. The agent has a **gold** detector that beeps when the agent is in a room containing gold. The agent can pick up the gold and leave the cave. The agent can also climb out of the cave without the gold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance\n",
    "The agent receives a reward of +1000 for climbing out of the cave with the gold, -1000 for falling into a pit or being eaten by the Wumpus, and -1 for each action taken. The game ends when the agent climbs out of the cave, dies, or takes more than 20 actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "The environment is represented by a 4x4 grid. The agent always starts in the bottom-left corner of the grid. The Wumpus, pits, and gold are placed randomly in the other rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions\n",
    "The agent can take the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Up`: Move up one room.\n",
    "- `Down`: Move down one room.\n",
    "- `Left`: Move left one room.\n",
    "- `Right`: Move right one room.\n",
    "- `Grab`: Grab the gold, if it is in the room.\n",
    "- `Climb`: Climb out of the cave, from the starting room.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensors\n",
    "The agent has the following sensors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Stench`: Detects a stench in adjacent rooms (not diagonally).\n",
    "* `Breeze`: Detects a breeze in adjacent rooms (not diagonally).\n",
    "* `Glitter`: Detects gold in the current room.\n",
    "* `Ladder`: Detects the ladder in the starting room.\n",
    "* `Bump`: Detects when the agent tries to move forward into a wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Board\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a Wumpus World board. Wind is represented by ☁️, gold by 🪙, and stench by 👃🏻.\n",
