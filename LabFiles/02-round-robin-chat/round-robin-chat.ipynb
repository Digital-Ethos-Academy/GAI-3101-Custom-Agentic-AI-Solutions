    "# Implementing Round-Robin Communication with AutoGen\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "> - Understand the basic concepts of round-robin communication\n",
    "> - Begin exploring the AutoGen framework\n",
    "> - Observe multiple agents communicating with each other\n",
    "> - Implement composite termination conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will implement a round-robin communication using the AutoGen framework. This is a basic form of Agentic AI and is a simple way to get started with the AutoGen framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In round-robin, agents take turns to communicate with each other. This order is sequential and is repeated until a termination condition is met. For example, we might have agents: A, B, and C. The order of communication would be A -> B -> C -> A -> B -> C -> ... and so on. Once a termination condition is met, the communication stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AutoGen Framework\n",
    "[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/index.html) is \"a framework for building AI agents and applications\" that is developed by Microsoft. It is designed to be a flexible and extensible framework that can be used to build a wide range of AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with the `autogen-agentchat` component which is design for building conversational single and multi-agent systems. This component is built on top of the `autogen` framework and provides a simple way to build agents that can communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Scenario\n",
    "Our agents will be tasked with writing a social media post for a fictional product named \"FlowState\". At the end of the lab, we will have three agents that will write, critique, and approve the social media post. Our agents are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Writer:** This agent will write the social media post. To ensure that we have a good example of communication, we will use the system prompt to force the writer to write poor quality posts.\n",
    "2. **Writing Critic:** This agent will critique the post written by the writer. It will provide feedback on the quality of the post.\n",
    "3. **Brand Manager:** This agent will ensure that the post meets the brand guidelines. If the post meets the guidelines, the post will be approved. If not, the writer will be asked to revise the post.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
