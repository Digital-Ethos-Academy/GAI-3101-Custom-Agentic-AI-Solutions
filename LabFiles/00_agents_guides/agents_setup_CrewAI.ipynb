    "## 1. Introduction & Core Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is CrewAI?\n",
    "\n",
    "**CrewAI** is a framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. Think of it as assembling a team of specialists who each have their own expertise, personality, and responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "| Principle | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Role-Playing** | Agents have roles, goals, and backstories that guide their behavior |\n",
    "| **Task-Oriented** | Work is organized into discrete, assignable tasks |\n",
    "| **Process-Driven** | Execution follows defined processes (sequential or hierarchical) |\n",
    "| **Tool-Equipped** | Agents can use tools to interact with external systems |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use CrewAI?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good for:**\n",
    "- Complex workflows requiring specialized expertise\n",
    "- Content creation pipelines (research → write → edit)\n",
    "- Analysis and report generation\n",
    "- Projects benefiting from clear role separation\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Consider alternatives when:**\n",
    "- You need simple single-agent tasks (use LangChain)\n",
    "- You need complex state management (use LangGraph)\n",
    "- You need conversational multi-agent systems (use AutoGen)\n",
    "\n",

    "### ✅ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Role Definition**: Be specific about what each agent does\n",
    "2. **Detailed Backstories**: Context improves agent behavior\n",
    "3. **Explicit Expected Outputs**: Tell agents exactly what you want\n",
    "4. **Task Dependencies**: Use context to chain task outputs\n",
    "5. **Start Sequential**: Only use hierarchical when needed\n",

    "### ❌ Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vague Goals**: \"Do good work\" vs \"Create a 500-word blog post\"\n",
    "2. **Missing Context**: Not connecting dependent tasks\n",
    "3. **Too Many Agents**: Start with 2-3 agents and scale up\n",
    "4. **No Verbose Mode**: Always debug with verbose=True first\n",
    "5. **Ignoring Rate Limits**: Set max_rpm for API constraints"
