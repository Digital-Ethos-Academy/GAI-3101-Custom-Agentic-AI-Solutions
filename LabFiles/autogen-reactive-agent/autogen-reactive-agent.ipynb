    "# Implementing a Reactive Agent in AutoGen\n",

    "> **Learning Outcomes:**\n",
    "> - Understand the purpose of a Reactive Agent\n",
    "> - Create a Reactive Agent in AutoGen\n",
    "> - Test the Reactive Agent in a simulated environment\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will implement a reactive agent team that can respond to changes in its environment in real-time. This type of agent is useful in scenarios where the environment is dynamic and the agent needs to adapt its behavior based on the current state of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AutoGen Framework\n",
    "[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/index.html) is \"a framework for building AI agents and applications\" that is developed by Microsoft. It is designed to be a flexible and extensible framework that can be used to build a wide range of AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with the `autogen-agentchat` component which is designed for building conversational single and multi-agent systems. This component is built on top of the `autogen` framework and provides a simple way to build agents that can communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scenario\n",
    "A company wants to automate the process of collecting competitive intelligence from _NovaTech Innovations_. Previously, they have used the RSS feed of the competitor's website to get updates on new products and services. However, the RSS feed is full of irrelevant information and the company wants to filter out the noise and only get updates on new products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our agents will be responsible for monitoring the RSS feed of _NovaTech Innovations_ and filtering out the irrelevant information. The agent should be able to identify new products and services based on the information in the RSS feed and provide a summary of the updates to the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "Let's start by installing the required libraries and setting the OpenAI API key. The OpenAI API key is required to access the OpenAI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following cells to install the required libraries and set the OpenAI API key.\n"

    "## Core\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 - Read the RSS Feed\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in building the reactive agent is to read the RSS feed of _NovaTech Innovations_. We will use the `feedparser` library to read the RSS feed. The `feedparser` library is a Python library that can parse RSS and Atom feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "RSS feeds don't \"push\" updates to subscribers. Instead, subscribers need to \"pull\" updates from the feed at regular intervals. This could be setup as a cron job or a scheduled task. The agents can then be triggered based on the updates in the feed. While this is not a real-time solution, it is a common approach for monitoring RSS feeds. As you deploy agents in a production environment, you will likely find this type of setup common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedparser is quite easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "feed = feedparser.parse('{the feed}}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell bellow, use the `feedparser` library to read the RSS feed of _NovaTech Innovations_ and print the title and summary of the feed entries. The RSS feed is stored in the `rss.xml` file. Explore the structure of the resulting feed to determine which fields may be relevant."

    "\n",
    "Now that we have read the RSS feed, we can implement the reactive agents. The agents should be able to filter out irrelevant information and identify important competitive intelligence in the feed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the agents have identified the important information, they should be able to provide a short summary of the information and why it is important.\n",
    "\n",
