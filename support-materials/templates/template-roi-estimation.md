## Proposed Solution Costs (Annual)

### Development Costs (One-Time)
| Cost Item | Hours | Hourly Rate | Total Cost |
|-----------|-------|-------------|------------|
| Initial agent development | | $ | $ |
| Testing & validation | | $ | $ |
| Integration work | | $ | $ |
| Training & documentation | | $ | $ |

|-----------|-------------|
| LLM API costs | $ |
| Infrastructure/hosting | $ |
| Monitoring & maintenance | $ |
| Human oversight (reduced) | $ |
| **Total Operating Cost** | **$** |

### **Total Solution Cost (Year 1)** = Development + Operating = **$______**
### **Total Solution Cost (Year 2+)** = Operating Only = **$______**

---

## ROI Calculation

### Year 1
- **Cost Savings** = Current State Cost - Operating Cost = **$______**
- **Net Benefit** = Cost Savings - Development Cost = **$______**
- **ROI** = (Net Benefit / Development Cost) × 100 = **____%**

### Year 2 (Steady State)
- **Cost Savings** = Current State Cost - Operating Cost = **$______**
- **ROI** = (Cost Savings / Operating Cost) × 100 = **____%**

### Payback Period
- **Months to Break Even** = Development Cost / (Monthly Savings) = **___ months**

---

## Value Beyond Cost Savings

### Quantifiable Benefits
| Benefit | Current | Target | Improvement |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Cycle time reduction | | | % |
| Error rate reduction | | | % |
| Throughput increase | | | % |
| Response time improvement | | | % |

### Qualitative Benefits
- [ ] Improved employee satisfaction
- [ ] Better customer experience
- [ ] Enhanced compliance/audit trail
- [ ] Increased innovation capacity
- [ ] Better data insights
- [ ] Scalability improvements
- [ ] 24/7 availability

## Risk-Adjusted ROI

### Risk Factors
| Risk | Impact (Low/Med/High) | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|----------------------|-------------|------------|
| LLM accuracy issues | | | |
| Integration complexity | | | |
| User adoption challenges | | | |
| Regulatory changes | | | |

### Conservative ROI Estimate
Apply a discount factor based on risk level:
- **Low Risk**: 10% reduction
- **Medium Risk**: 25% reduction
- **High Risk**: 40% reduction

**Risk-Adjusted Year 1 ROI** = **____%**
**Risk-Adjusted Year 2 ROI** = **____%**
