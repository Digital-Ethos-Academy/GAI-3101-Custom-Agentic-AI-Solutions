    "# Integrating an Observation Tool in an Agent - SOLUTION\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Learning Outcomes:**\n",
    "> - Create an observation tool with AutoGen.\n",
    "> - Integrate the observation tool with an agent.\n",
    "> - Understand the AutoGen Agent flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will implement an observation tool that will allow the agent to observe their environment. This tool won't have any affect on the world outside of the agent, but will allow the agent to gather information about that world. This is a useful capacity for an agent to have, as it allows the agent to make more informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AutoGen Framework\n",
    "[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/index.html) is \"a framework for building AI agents and applications\" that is developed by Microsoft. It is designed to be a flexible and extensible framework that can be used to build a wide range of AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with the `autogen-agentchat` component which is designed for building conversational single and multi-agent systems. This component is built on top of the `autogen` framework and provides a simple way to build agents that can communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scenario\n",
    "Our agent will be tasked with converting Wikipedia pages into a timeline. The agent will be able to observe the Wikipedia page and extract the information needed to create the timeline. The agent will then be able to use this information to create a timeline of the events described in the Wikipedia page. If the agent needs additional information, it can perform more observations to gather that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "Let's start by installing the required libraries and setting the OpenAI API key. The OpenAI API key is required to access the OpenAI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following cells to install the required libraries and set the OpenAI API key.\n"

It is located at the southern tip of New York State on New York Harbor, one of the world's largest natural harbors. The city comprises five boroughs, each coextensive with its respective county. It is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the United States by both population and urban area. New York is a global center of finance and commerce, culture, technology, entertainment and media, academics and scientific output, the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations, international diplomacy.\\nWith an estimated population in July 2024 of 8,478,072, distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), the city is the most densely populated major city in the United States. New York City has more than double the population of Los Angeles, the country's second-most populous city. Over 20.1 million people live in New York City's metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, both the largest in the U.S. New York City is one of the world's most populous megacities. The city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. An estimated 800 languages are spoken in New York City, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. The New York City metropolitan region is home to the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world, approximately 5.9 million as of 2023.\\nNew York City traces its origins to Fort Amsterdam and a trading post founded on Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists around 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664 and was temporarily renamed New York after King Charles II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York, before being permanently renamed New York in 1674. Following independence from Great Britain, the city was the national capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. The modern city was formed by the 1898 consolidation of its five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island.\\nAnchored by Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world's premier financial and fintech center and the most economically powerful city in the world. As of 2022, the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy in the world, with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.16 trillion. The New York metropolitan area's economy is larger than all but nine countries. Despite having a 24/7 rapid transit system, New York also leads the world in urban automobile traffic congestion. The city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization of their listed companies: the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. New York City is an established haven for global investors. As of 2025, New York City is the most expensive city in the world for expatriates and has by a wide margin the highest residential rents of any American city.

       "'A carillon (US:  KARR-ə-lon, UK:  kə-RIL-yən) is a pitched percussion instrument that is played with a keyboard and consists of at least 23 bells. The bells are cast in bronze, hung in fixed suspension, and tuned in chromatic order so that they can be sounded harmoniously together. They are struck with clappers connected to a keyboard of wooden batons played with the hands and pedals played with the feet. Often housed in bell towers, carillons are usually owned by churches, universities, or municipalities. They can include an automatic system through which the time is announced and simple tunes are played throughout the day.\\nCarillons come in many designs, weights, sizes, and sounds. They are among the world\\'s heaviest instruments, and the heaviest carillon weighs over 91 metric tons (100 short tons). Most weigh between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons). To be considered a carillon, a minimum of 23 bells is needed; otherwise, it is called a chime. Standard-sized instruments have about 50, and the world\\'s largest has 77 bells. The appearance of  carillons depends on the number and weight of the bells and the tower in which they are housed. They may be found in towers that are free-standing or connected to a building. The bells of a carillon may be directly exposed to the elements or hidden inside the structure of their towers.\\nThe origins of the carillon can be traced to the Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—in the 16th century. The modern carillon was invented in 1644 when Jacob van Eyck and the Hemony brothers cast the first tuned carillon. The instrument experienced a peak until the late 18th century, a decline during the French Revolution, a revival in the late 19th century, a second decline during the First and Second World Wars, and a second revival thereafter. UNESCO has designated 56 belfries in Belgium and France as a World Heritage Site and recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage.\\nAccording to counts by various registries, about 700 carillons exist worldwide. Most are in and around the Low Countries, though nearly 200 have been constructed in North America. Almost all extant carillons were constructed in the 20th century. Additionally, about 500 \"non-traditional\" carillons are known that most registries do not consider to be carillons due to some component of their action being electrified or computerized. A plurality of them is located in the United States, and most of the others are in Western Europe. A few \"traveling\" or \"mobile\" carillons are fixed to a frame that enables them to be transported.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology and terminology ==\\nThe word carillon is a loanword from French dating to the late 18th century. It is derived from Old French carignon (an alteration of quarregon) \\'a set of four bells\\'. The word quarregon originates from Latin quaternionem \\'set of four\\'; from quater \\'four times\\'. The word carillon is often stated to have referred originally to a set of four forestrike bells, whose melodies announced the time signal of public hour bells, but this is not confirmed by archival sources. Some convincing evidence shows that the term referred initially to the medieval custom of chiming on sets of four church bells by pulling the clappers by means of ropes. In German, as well as using the French term, a carillon is sometimes called a Glockenspiel (lit.\\u2009\\'bells set\\'). This should not be confused with the identically named glockenspiel, which itself is sometimes called a carillon in French. Dutch speakers use the word beiaard, which has an uncertain etymology.\\nA musician who plays the carillon is commonly called a carillonneur (US:  KERR-ə-lə-NUR, UK:  kə-RIL-yə-NUR), also lent from French. It and carillon were adopted by English speakers after the introduction of the instrument to British troops following the War of the Spanish Succession in the 18th century. Though the French word carillonneur literally refers to carillon players who are men, the French carillonneuse to denote women is not used in English. Another common term is the English carillonist, which some players of the carillon have wished to replace carillonneur because of the former\\'s gender inclusivity, simple spelling, and unambiguous pronunciation. In 2018, the World Carillon Federation adopted carillonist as the preferred term for its communications.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Construction ===\\n\\nThe carillon is a keyboard instrument. Though it shares similarities with other instruments in this category, such as the organ or pedal piano, its playing console is unique. Playing is done with the player\\'s hands on a manual keyboard composed of rounded, wooden batons. The manual has short chromatic keys (i.e. \"black keys\") raised above the diatonic keys (\"white keys\") and arranged like a piano, but they are spaced far apart, and the chromatic keys are raised above the rest, about 10 cm (4 in). To operate, the keys are depressed with a closed fist. The lowest one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half octaves of the manual are connected to a pedal keyboard played with the feet. The connection is direct, meaning that when a pedal is pressed, its corresponding key on the manual is pulled down with it. Since the mid-20th century, two keyboard design standards have competed for a carillon\\'s console: the North American standard and the North European standard. They differ over several design elements, such as whether the outer pedals curve toward the center or the specific distance a key is depressed. In 2006, the World Carillon Federation developed the WCF Keyboard 2006, which is a compromise between the two standards. The organization recommends that its keyboard standard be used as a guideline when constructing new carillons or renovating existing keyboards.\\n\\nEach key is connected to a transmission system by a wire, usually made of stainless steel. When a particular key is depressed, it pulls on the wire, which after interacting with other wires and pulleys, causes a clapper to swing towards the inner wall of the key\\'s corresponding bell. At rest, these clappers are about 2 to 4 cm (0.8 to 1.6 in) away from the bell wall. Small bells are fitted with springs to pull their clappers back immediately after the stroke, so that the bell is not sounded more than once with each keystroke. This is not necessary for large bells, which have sufficiently heavy clappers. Immediately above each key is a wire adjuster called a turnbuckle. These allow the performer to adjust the length of the wire, which often changes with temperature fluctuations.\\nThe carillon\\'s cast-bronze, cup-shaped bells are housed at the top of a tower in a structure typically made of steel or wooden beams. The arrangement of the bells depends on the space, height, and construction of the tower, and the number and size of bells. When the heaviest bells are especially large, they are usually placed below the playing cabin to achieve a better tonal distribution. The bells do not move during operation, only the clappers. With some instruments, the heaviest bells may be outfitted with a mechanism enabling them to swing.\\n\\n\\n=== Mechanization with clock and playing drum ===\\n\\nCarillons may also feature an automatic mechanism by which simple tunes or the Westminster Quarters are played on the lower bells. The mechanism on European carillons is often a playing drum, which is a large metal cylinder connected to a clock mechanism. Metal pegs are screwed onto the outside of the drum. When the clock mechanism sets the drum in motion, the pegs catch onto levers, connected to hammers that rest just a short distance from the outside of the bell. The hammers are briefly raised, and then fall onto the bell as the peg continues to rotate away from the lever. The pegs are arranged such that simple tunes can be programmed to play at specific quarter hours. In North America, automatic-playing drum systems are not common; instead, carillons may have pneumatic systems, which ring the instrument.\\n\\n\\n=== Sound ===\\n\\nCarillons produce sound by striking stationary bells, categorizing them as percussion idiophones in the Hornbostel–Sachs classification of musical instruments (111.242.222 – sets of bells with internal strikers). Carillon bells are made of bell bronze, a specialized copper–tin alloy used for its above-average rigidity and resonance. A bell\\'s profile (shape) and weight determine its note and the quality of its tone. Therefore, apart from changes in its profile, such as chipping or corrosion, a bell will never lose its original sound. It produces a sound with overtones, also known as partial tones, which are not necessarily harmonically related. To produce a pleasing, harmonically related series of tones, the bell\\'s profile must be carefully adjusted. Bellfounders typically focus on five principal tones when tuning, most notably the minor third overtone called the tierce, which gives rise to the unique sound of carillons and has been the subject of further research, such as the major third bell. Since the casting process does not reliably produce perfectly tuned bells, they are cast slightly thicker and metal is shaved off with a lathe. On older European carillons, bells were tuned with each other using the meantone temperament tuning system. Modern carillons, particularly those in North America, are tuned to equal temperament.\\n\\nThe carillon has a dynamic range similar to a piano, if not more versatile. Through variation of touch, performers can express many volumes. The larger the bell, the larger its dynamic range. Bigger bells will also sound naturally louder than smaller, higher-pitched bells.\\nAlong with pipe organs, carillons are among the world\\'s heaviest musical instruments. Most carillons weigh (counting only the weight of the bells) between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons), with extremes ranging from very light 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) instruments to the world\\'s heaviest at over 91 metric tons (100 short tons)—the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon of the Riverside Church in New York City, US. Its bourdon, or largest bell, is the largest tuned bell ever cast for a carillon. It sounds a full octave below most other bourdons. The entire ensemble of fixed and swinging bells, clappers, and steel framework weighs more than 226 metric tons (249 short tons).\\n\\n\\n=== Range ===\\nA carillon\\'s range is determined by the number of bells it has, which usually depends on funds available for the creation of the instrument; more money allows more bells to be cast, especially the larger, more costly ones. A carillon, as generally accepted, must have a minimum of 23 bells, or else it is called a chime. No standard pitch range for the carillon has been established, so several subcategories are used to categorize them:\\n\\nCarillons with 23 to 27 bells and 35 to 39 bells are classified as two-octave and three-octave carillons, respectively. Players of these instruments often use music written specifically for the limited ranges.\\nA \"concert\" or \"standard\" carillon typically has 45 to 50 bells, or a range of about four octaves.\\nCarillons with more than 50 bells are often referred to as \"great\" or \"grand\" carillons.\\nCarillons of 15 to 22 bells, which were built before 1940, may be classified as \"historical carillons\" by the World Carillon Federation.\\n\\nThe title of \"world\\'s largest carillon by number of bells\" is shared between two instruments: the carillon of the Kirk in the Hills Presbyterian Church in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, US, and the carillon at the Daejeon Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea; both have 77 bells.\\nSince a carillon is seldom played in concert with other instruments, its bourdon may be any pitch—whichever is advantageous for the location and funds available; to simplify the writing and playing of music, keyboards often have a C-compass. As a result, many carillons are transposing instruments, especially those that are small, have many bells, or were constructed on limited funds. The transposition can vary from down a perfect fourth to up an octave. In North America, increasing numbers of new carillons have been installed in concert pitch as a result of the desire to establish the carillon as a full-fledged concert instrument.\\nMany carillons, according to a C-compass, are missing the lowest C♯ and E♭ bells (equating to the second- and fourth-largest bells if they were included). The reason is often financial; by omitting these bells, the construction of a carillon can be reduced significantly, sometimes by 20% for large installations. Since the early 1900s, European installations often reintroduce the E♭ bell, and instead of adding the C♯ bell, they include a B♭ bell (which is a major second below the C-compass bell).\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\nThe carillon originated from two earlier functions of bells: ringing bells to send messages or to indicate the time of day.\\nBellringers attached ropes to the clappers of swinging bells and rang them while stationary in a technique called chiming. Chiming bells gave the ringer more control compared to swinging bells, so was used to send messages to those within earshot. For example, sounding bells was often used to warn of a fire or impending attack. At celebratory events, a bellringer could gather ropes together to chime multiple bells in rhythmic patterns. By the end of the 15th century, chimers are recorded to have used their technique to play music on bells. A 1478 chronicle recounts a man in Dunkirk having made a \"great innovation in honor of God\" by playing melodies on bells. Another one recounts in 1482 a jester from Aalst playing bells in Antwerp with ropes and batons, the latter term suggesting the existence of a keyboard.\\n\\nIn the 14th century, the newly developed escapement technology for mechanical clocks spread throughout European clock towers and gradually replaced the water clock. Since the earliest clocks lacked faces, they announced the time by striking a bell a number of times corresponding to the hour. Eventually, these striking clocks were modified to make a warning signal just before the hour count to draw the attention of listeners to the upcoming announcement. This signal is called the forestrike (Dutch: voorslag). Originally, the forestrike consisted of striking one or two bells, and the systems slowly grew in complexity. By the middle of the 15th century, forestrikes, with three to seven bells, could play simple melodies.\\nAs late as 1510, these two functions were combined into one primitive carillon in the Oudenaarde Town Hall. One set of nine bells was connected to both a keyboard and the clock\\'s forestrike. The Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—were most interested in the potential of using bells to make music. In this region, bellfounding had reached an advanced stage relative to other regions in Europe.\\n\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nThe new instrument developed in the favorable conditions in the Low Countries during the 17th century. Bellfounders found increased financial and technological support as the region traded by sea through ports. Moreover, the political situation under Margaret of Austria and Holy Roman emperor Charles V brought relative wealth and power to cities. Carillons quickly became a fashionable symbol of civic prestige. Cities and towns competed against one another to possess the largest, highest-quality instruments. The demand was met by a successful industry of bellfounding families, notably the Waghevens and Vanden Gheyns. Together, they produced over 50 carillons during the 16th and early 17th centuries. By 1600, the primitive carillon had become an established feature of the region.\\n\\nA critical development for the modern carillon occurred in the 17th century, which involved a partnership between Pieter and François Hemony and Jacob van Eyck. The Hemony brothers were prominent bellfounders known for their precise tuning technique. Van Eyck was a renowned blind carillonneur of Utrecht, who was commissioned by several Dutch cities to maintain and make improvements to their clock chimes and carillons. He was particularly interested in the sounds of bells. In 1633, he developed the ability to isolate and describe a bell\\'s five main overtones and discovered a bell\\'s partial tones can be tuned harmoniously with each other by adjusting the bell\\'s thickness. The Hemony brothers were commissioned in 1644 to cast 19 bells for Zutphen\\'s Wijnhuistoren with Van Eyck as their consultant. By tuning the bells with the advice from Van Eyck, they created the first carillon by the modern definition. According to carillonneur John Gouwens, the quality of the bells was so impressive that Van Eyck recommended casting a full two octaves, or 23 bells. This range has been considered the standard minimum range for carillons ever since. During the next 36 years, the Hemony brothers produced 51 carillons. Carillon culture experienced a peak around this time and until the late-18th century.\\n\\n\\n=== Decline ===\\nThe French Revolution had far-reaching consequences on the Low Countries and the carillon. France conquered and annexed the Austrian Netherlands in 1795 and the United Provinces in 1810. After publishing instructions for extracting copper from bell bronze, France sought to dismantle local carillons to reduce its copper shortage. Carillon owners resisted, for example, by petitioning the new governments to declare their instruments as \"culturally significant\" or by disconnecting the bells and burying them in secret. During this period, as many as 110 carillons existed. About 50 of them were destroyed as a result of war, fire, and dismantling. The majority were melted down to produce cannons for the French Revolutionary Wars.\\nBetween 1750 and the end of the 19th century, interest in the carillon declined greatly. An increasing number of households had access to grandfather clocks and pocket watches, which eroded the carillon\\'s monopoly on announcing the time. As a musical instrument, the carillon lagged behind during the Romantic era, which featured music of a wandering, story-like nature. Many carillons were tuned using meantone temperament, which meant they were not suited for the chromaticism of the newer musical styles. The production of new musical works for the instrument essentially came to a standstill. The standard skill level of carillonneurs had also dropped significantly, so much so that in 1895, the music publisher Schott frères issued Matthias Vanden Gheyn\\'s 11 carillon preludes for piano with a foreword claiming \"no carillonneur of our time knows how to play them on the carillon\". Also, with a reduced demand for new carillons, the tuning techniques developed by the Hemony brothers, but not Van Eyck\\'s underlying theory, were forgotten. Subsequent carillons were generally inferior to earlier installations.\\n\\n\\n=== Revival ===\\nIn the early 1890s, an English change ringer and canon Arthur Simpson published a set of articles on bell tuning, where he argued bell founders had been complacent with their poor tuning methods and proposed solutions to the existing problems. John William Taylor, who had been trying to replicate the tuning techniques of the Hemony brothers and the Vanden Gheyns at his foundry, began working with Simpson. In 1904, they founded the first tuned bells in over a century. The rediscovery initiated a revival of carillon building.\\nIn Mechelen, Belgium, Jef Denyn was a major figure in the carillon\\'s revival as a musical instrument. In 1887, after his father had become completely blind, Denyn took over as the city carillonneur and was responsible for playing the carillon in the tower of St. Rumbold\\'s Cathedral. From the beginning of his career, Denyn advocated for better playability of the instrument. He further developed the tumbler rack system of transmission cables that his father had installed on the cathedral carillon. This allowed the player to have better control over dynamic variations, fast musical passages, and tremolos. Tremolos offered a solution to a Romantic-era limitation of the carillon: its inability to expressively sustain the sound of individual notes.\\n\\nWith his improving skills as a carillonneur and the upgraded cathedral carillon, Denyn\\'s performances began attracting crowds of listeners. He established regular Monday-night concerts at the suggestion of the city council. On 1 August 1892, Denyn hosted the first carillon concert in history. From this point forward, the instrument garnered a reputation as a concert instrument, rather than as an instrument tasked with providing background music.\\n\\n\\n=== Impact of the World Wars ===\\nBecause of his concerts, Denyn met William Gorham Rice, an American state and federal government official from Albany, New York, US. Having traveled to The Hague and been exposed to the carillon, Rice was regularly touring the region to interview carillonneurs for his research. After Denyn\\'s 18 August 1913 evening concert, he and Rice exchanged ideas about the societal and educational value of carillon performances for large audiences. Rice\\'s book Carillons of Belgium and Holland, the first in the English language written specifically about carillons, was published in December 1914 and reprinted three times. The book painted an idealized picture of the region that resonated with the American public, particularly in light of the rape of Belgium. Its success motivated Rice to publish two more books in 1915 and 1925. Rice became an authority on carillons in the United States; besides his books, he gave 35 lectures in several cities, published articles in magazines, spoke on radio programs, and presented exhibition material on the subject between 1912 and 1922. In 1922, Rice garnered financial support from Herbert Hoover and John D. Rockefeller Jr. to establish a carillon school in Mechelen, with Denyn as its first director. It was later named the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\".\\n\\nStephen Thorne of the Canadian military history magazine Legion writes that the Allied Powers of World War I and of World War II saw the destruction of carillons during the respective wars as a \"brutal annihilation of a unique democratic music instrument\". The destruction was highly publicized among the allies of Belgium and the Netherlands. In the latter war, British investigators claimed Germany seized two-thirds of all bells in Belgium and every bell in the Netherlands. Between 1938 and 1945, 175,000 bells were stolen and stored in \"bell cemeteries\" (German: Glockenfriedhöfe). Some 150,000 were sent to foundries and melted down for their copper. Following the war, with the bells out of their towers, E. W. Van Heuven and other physicists could research the tonal qualities of bells in laboratory conditions and with modern electrical sound-analyzing equipment. Percival Price, the Dominion carillonneur at the Peace Tower, was tasked with repatriating as many surviving bells as possible. He also used the opportunity to publish similar research. Every bellfounder could then learn how to cast the highest-quality bells, and the increase in new carillons was greater than ever.\\n\\n\\n=== Movement in North America ===\\nBetween 1922 and 1940, bellfounders installed 43 carillons in the United States and Canada. The flood of carillons onto the continent is attributed to Rice\\'s widely popular books and persistent education in the United States. His romanticized depiction of the cultural instrument prompted wealthy donors to purchase carillons for their own civil and religious communities. Price was appointed to play the carillon at the Metropolitan United Church in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (before working as the Dominion carillonneur); Mary Mesquita Dahlmer was appointed to play at Our Lady of Good Voyage Church in Gloucester, Massachusetts, US. Both were the first professional carillonneurs in their respective countries. In 1936, The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America was founded at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Following the deaths of Denyn in 1941 and Rice in 1945, North American carillonneurs, through their new organization, sought to develop their own authority on education and performance. In the 1950s and 1960s, a distinct North American style of carillon music emerged at the University of Kansas. Ronald Barnes, the university\\'s carillonneur, led in the style and encouraged his peers to compose for the carillon, and produced many of his own compositions.\\n\\n\\n=== International recognition ===\\nIn the 1970s, the idea for a global carillon organization took shape, and the World Carillon Federation was later formed as the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of the pre-existing national or regional carillon associations that had been founded throughout the 20th century.\\nIn 1999, UNESCO designated 32 bell towers in Belgium as a World Heritage Site, in recognition of their architectural diversity and significance. The list was expanded in 2005 to include 23 in France, as well as the tower of Gembloux, Belgium. In 2014, UNESCO recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage, stating that it \"recognizes the creativity of carillonneurs and others who ensure that this cultural form remains relevant to today\\'s local societies.\"\\nIn 2008, the carillon was featured in the film Welcome to the Sticks, a box-office success as the highest-grossing French film ever released in France as of 2021.\\nIn 2019, playing the carillon of St. Coleman\\'s Cathedral in Cobh, Ireland, was recognized by the Irish government as key element of the country\\'s living cultural heritage. In 2025, the casting of bells and playing music on bells was added to Germany\\'s list of intangible cultural heritage.\\n\\n\\n== Usage and repertoire ==\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n\\nThe carillon repertoire skews heavily toward newer works in stark contrast to that of its relative, the organ repertoire. Some 15 collections of carillon music written in the 17th and 18th centuries are known to exist. Like with the pipe organ, early carillon performances consisted mostly of improvisations. In the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, keyboard music was not written for one instrument or another, but rather was written to be played on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the carillon\\'s repertoire in its early history was likely the same as that of the harpsichord, organ, and piano. One of the few surviving examples is the De Gruytters carillon book, dated 1746. The music is arranged,rather than composed, for performance on the carillon and could easily be played on other keyboard instruments. Baroque keyboard music is well suited for carillon transcription, particularly the works of Bach, Corelli, Couperin, Handel, Mozart, and Vivaldi.\\n\\nThe earliest known original compositions specifically for the carillon, and not simply any keyboard, are the 11 preludes of Matthias Vanden Gheyn. The structure of his works suggests he had been playing nonspecific keyboard music on the carillon for many years and that he wanted to play music that is idiomatic to the instrument. Technically challenging, his preludes have been the standard repertoire among carillonneurs since the early 1900s.\\nJef Denyn made many public statements about what music should be performed on the carillon, and he persuaded several composers of the time to write for it. Among those composers were his students, including Staf Nees, Léon Henry, and Jef Rottiers, and composers for other instruments, such as Jef van Hoof. The carillon school began publishing carillon music in 1925. Through his school, Denyn was the early proponent of the \"Mechelen style\" of carillon music, which consists of virtuosic flourishes, tremolos, and other Baroque and Romantic elements.\\nRonald Barnes was the leading figure behind the North American style of carillon music, which developed in the 1950s and 1960s. He encouraged his University of Kansas peers to compose for the carillon, and he produced many of his own compositions. Barnes\\' campaign was most successful with Roy Hamlin Johnson, a piano professor who introduced a whole category of music exclusively native to the carillon featuring the octatonic scale. Many of Johnson\\'s works are acknowledged as masterpieces. Barnes produced 56 original compositions and hundreds of arrangements to expand the available repertoire. Other major 20th-century contributors were Albert Gerken, Gary C. White, Johan Franco, John Pozdro, and Jean W. Miller. The new American style developed into the antithesis of the Mechelen style; instead of exciting, tremolo-filled performances that demonstrate the showmanship of the carillonneur, it features slow passages, sparse harmonies, and impressionist themes to draw the listener\\'s attention to the natural sound of the bells.\\n\\nCarillon music was first published in North America in 1934. G. Schirmer, Inc. published the compositions of Curtis Institute of Music students Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, and Nino Rota as part of the institute\\'s short-lived publishing series. The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America opened the first dedicated publishing house for carillon music in North America in 1961. In 1968, the Anton Brees Carillon Library was established at Bok Tower Gardens in Lake Wales, Florida, US; it contains large collections of carillon music and related materials.\\nIn the late 2010s, University of Michigan professor Tiffany Ng analyzed the diversity of the carillon repertoire. In a bibliography focusing on African-American music and composers, Ng claims, \"while African-American music permeates the carillon repertoire,\" mostly in the form of spirituals, \"almost none of the carillon arrangements and compositions are authored by African Americans.\" In a second bibliography with Emmet Lewis focusing on women, transgender, and non-binary composers, they assert that while many works have been written by these groups, they are often not published through traditional means, and \"gender inequality remains systemic and common practice in carillon concerts.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Performances ===\\n\\nPerformances on the carillon are commonly categorized as either recitals or concerts. Carillon recitals are traditional performances that take place on fixed schedules throughout the week. They may supplement regularly scheduled events, or take place at the convenience of the carillonneur. Traditional since the instrument\\'s inception, this method is the foundation of carillon performance. Concerts refer to special carillon performances, typically featuring a program and a place for the audience to sit and listen. Some carillonneurs may livestream the event so the audience can watch them at the keyboard. The first carillon concert was held on 1 August 1892 as part of Jef Denyn\\'s Monday-evening concert series.\\nThe lack of consistent interest in traditional performances among the general public has caused carillonneurs to engage in musical collaborations and experiments, collectively referred to as \"Carillon Plus\". Carillonneur duos explore the possibility of duet playing and producing new music for the configuration. Others seek to play the carillon in orchestras, bands, and other ensembles. Carillon Plus performances are not new, but have been explored more intensely since the mid-20th century.\\n\\n\\n== Organization and education ==\\nThe World Carillon Federation is the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of pre-existing regional, national, and supranational carillon organizations. As of 2025, it is composed of 15 member organizations:\\n\\nEvery three years, the federation hosts an international congress in a home country of one of the member organizations. The congresses host lectures, workshops, and committee meetings about the topics related to the carillon, for example: news, tutorials and demonstrations, and research developments. Most member organizations give periodic updates to their members on the state of carillon culture in their respective regions.\\n\\nTraining to perform on a carillon can be obtained at several institutions, though the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\" has been the most popular. The LUCA School of Arts in Leuven, Belgium, offers a master\\'s degree in the carillon, and the Utrecht School of the Arts in Amersfoort, Netherlands, has a dedicated school. The Scandinavian Carillon School is located in Denmark, and there are schools in the United Kingdom and France.\\nThe Guild of Carillonneurs in North America organizes carillon examinations during its annual congresses. Those who pass are certified as carillonneur-members of the guild. It also partners with the North American Carillon School, founded in 2012 as an affiliate of the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\". Several American universities offer a carillon program within their curriculum. For example, the University of California, Berkeley; the University of California, Santa Barbara; the University of Denver; the University of Florida; and the University of Michigan offer complete courses of study. Clemson University, Indiana University, Iowa State University, the University of Kansas, and Marquette University offer limited credit for carillon performance. Employed carillonneurs will often offer private lessons at their carillons. Universities that possess a carillon but do not offer course credit often have a student organization or education program, such as the Yale Guild of Carillonneurs, which manages performances on the Yale Memorial Carillon, and the University of Chicago Guild of Carillonists.\\nMusic competitions for carillon are held regularly, with the international Queen Fabiola Competition being the most important.\\n\\n\\n== Distribution ==\\n\\nSeveral institutions register and count carillons worldwide. Some registries specialize in counting specific types of carillons. For example, the War Memorial and Peace Carillons registry counts instruments that serve as war memorials or were built in the name of promoting world peace. TowerBells counts carillons played via a baton keyboard as \"traditional carillons\" and those with computerized or electronic mechanisms as \"non-traditional carillons\", among other bell instruments. It also publishes maps, technical specifications, and summary statistics. As the World Carillon Federation does not consider non-traditional carillons to be carillons, it counts only those which are played via a baton keyboard and without computerized or electronic mechanisms.\\nAccording to TowerBells and the World Carillon Federation,  about 700 traditional carillons exist. At least three can be found on every continent except Antarctica; however, of the countries in which traditional carillons can be found, only six have more than 20. The \"great carillon\" countries—the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United States—account for two-thirds of the world total. Over 90% are in either Western Europe (mainly the Low Countries) or North America. In North America, about 80% of carillons are owned by religious or educational institutions, while in Europe, nearly all carillons are municipally owned. Almost all extant traditional carillons were constructed in the last 100 years; only some 50 historical carillons from the 18th century or earlier still exist. According to TowerBells, there are another 483 non-traditional carillons, which are located mainly in the United States and Western Europe.\\n\\n\\n== Traveling carillons ==\\n\\nTraveling or mobile carillons are those which are not housed in a tower. Instead, the bells and playing console are installed on a frame that allows it to be transported. These carillons have to be much lighter than their non-mobile counterparts. Nora Johnston conceived the idea of a traveling carillon between 1933 and 1938. She connected a traditional baton keyboard to a system of chime bars and fixed the structure to a portable frame. Johnston traveled twice to the United States to perform in radio documentaries, orchestral concerts, and commercials. Subsequent constructions by others used actual carillon bells.\\nAccording to counts by the World Carillon Federation and TowerBells, there are about 20 existing traveling carillons with only three being non-traditional. Many were or are owned by bell foundries as a promotional tool. Almost all traveling carillons are headquartered in Western Europe and the United States. Two American traveling carillons are part of the musical group Cast in Bronze, which features the \"Spirit of the Bells\" playing the carillon in concert with other instruments or a recording. Cast in Bronze is credited with introducing the carillon to the United States\\' public in its mission to promote and preserve the instrument.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nBianzhong, an Eastern instrument having clapperless bells that are struck with hammers\\nCanpanò – Italian bell ringing\\nElectronic carillon\\nFull circle ringing\\nBolognese bell ringing\\nChange ringing\\nVeronese bell ringing\\nRussian Orthodox bell ringing\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nEnglish-speaking carillon organizations\\nWorld Carillon Federation\\nCarillon Society of Britain and Ireland\\nCarillon Society of Australia\\nThe Guild of Carillonneurs in North America\\nNorth American Carillon School\\nShort educational video about the carillon from the World Carillon Federation\\nShort video tutorial on composing for the carillon\\nTutorial website on arranging for the carillon\\nMuseum Klok en Peel (Carillon museum in the Netherlands)'"

      "[FunctionExecutionResult(content='Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.\\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5, capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing. Currently only versions in the 3.x series are supported. \\nPython has gained widespread use in the machine learning community. It is widely taught as an introductory programming language. Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Python implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from responsibilities as Python\\'s \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker. (He has since come out of retirement and is self-titled \"BDFL-emeritus\".) In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.\\nThe name Python derives from the British comedy series Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus. (See § Naming.)\\nPython 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, featuring many new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 2.7\\'s end-of-life was initially set for 2015, and then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. It no longer receives security patches or updates. While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e., \"2.7.18+\" (plus 3.11), with the plus signifying (at least some) \"backported security updates\".\\nPython 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, and was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions, with some new semantics and changed syntax. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. Several releases in the Python 3.x series have added new syntax to the language, and made a few (considered very minor) backward-incompatible changes.\\nAs of November 2025, Python 3.14.0 is the latest stable release, and Python 3.13.9 was released a week later, all older 3.x versions had a security update down to Python 3.9.24 then again with 3.9.25, the final version in 3.9 series. Python 3.10 is, since November 2025, the oldest supported branch. Python 3.15 has an alpha released, and Android has a official downloadable executable available for Python 3.14. Releases receive two years of full support followed by three years of security support.\\n\\n\\n== Design philosophy and features ==\\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming – including metaprogramming and metaobjects. Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python is often referred to as a \\'glue language\\' because it is purposely designed to be able to integrate components written in other languages.\\nPython uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\\nPython\\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp tradition\". It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.\\nPython\\'s core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20) written by Tim Peters, which includes aphorisms such as these:\\n\\nExplicit is better than implicit.\\nSimple is better than complex.\\nReadability counts.\\nSpecial cases aren\\'t special enough to break the rules.\\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\\nErrors should never pass silently.\\nUnless explicitly silenced.\\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\\nHowever, Python has received criticism for violating these principles and adding unnecessary language bloat. Responses to these criticisms note that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. The addition of some new features had been controversial: Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life after conflict about adding the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8\\u2009.\\nNevertheless, rather than building all functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum\\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which represented the opposite approach.\\nPython claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar, while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. Python lacks do while loops, which Rossum considered harmful. In contrast to Perl\\'s motto \"there is more than one way to do it\", Python advocates an approach where \"there should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it\". In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve a given goal. There are at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use. Alex Martelli is a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author; he wrote that \"To describe something as \\'clever\\' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"\\nPython\\'s developers typically prioritise readability over performance. For example, they reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer increases in speed that do not justify the cost of clarity and readability. Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. Also, it is possible to transpile to other languages. However, this approach either fails to achieve the expected speed-up, since Python is a very dynamic language, or only a restricted subset of Python is compiled (with potential minor semantic changes).\\nPython is meant to be a fun language to use. This goal is reflected in the name – a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python – and in playful approaches to some tutorials and reference materials. For instance, some code examples use the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (in reference to a Monty Python sketch), rather than the typical terms \"foo\" and \"bar\".\\nA common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a broad range of meanings related to program style: Pythonic code may use Python idioms well; be natural or show fluency in the language; or conform with Python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability.\\n\\n\\n== Syntax and semantics ==\\n\\nPython is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.\\n\\n\\n=== Indentation ===\\n\\nPython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program\\'s visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.\\n\\n\\n=== Statements and control flow ===\\nPython\\'s statements include the following:\\n\\nThe assignment statement, using a single equals sign =\\nThe if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else if)\\nThe for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a variable for use by the attached block; the variable is not deleted when the loop finishes\\nThe while statement, which executes a block of code as long as boolean condition is true\\nThe try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses (or new syntax except* in Python 3.11 for exception groups); the try statement also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits\\nThe raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception\\nThe class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming\\nThe def statement, which defines a function or method\\nThe with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager, allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom Examples of a context include acquiring a lock before some code is run, and then releasing the lock; or opening and then closing a file\\nThe break statement, which exits a loop\\nThe continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next\\nThe del statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined \\nThe pass statement, serving as a NOP (i.e., no operation), which is syntactically needed to create an empty code block\\nThe assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply\\nThe yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines\\nThe return statement, used to return a value from a function\\nThe import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program\\nThe match and case statements, analogous to a switch statement construct, which compares an expression against one or more cases as a control-flow measure\\nThe assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\\nPython does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations; according to Van Rossum, the language never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python\\'s generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, data can be passed through multiple stack levels.\\n\\n\\n=== Expressions ===\\nPython\\'s expressions include the following:\\n\\nThe +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of division in Python: floor division (or integer division) //, and floating-point division /. Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation.\\nPython uses the + operator for string concatenation. The language uses the * operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times.\\nThe @ infix operator is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.\\nThe syntax :=, called the \"walrus operator\", was introduced in Python 3.8. This operator assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.\\nIn Python, == compares two objects by value. Python\\'s is operator may be used to compare object identities (i.e., comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, a <= b <= c.\\nPython uses and, or, and not as Boolean operators.\\nPython has a type of expression called a list comprehension, and a more general expression called a generator expression.\\nAnonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body.\\nConditional expressions are written as x if c else y. (This is different in operand order from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages.)\\nPython makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (since dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided that all of the tuple\\'s elements are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. For example, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); this result is then assigned back to t—thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.\\nPython features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to something assignable (e.g., a variable or a writable property) are associated just as in forming tuple literal; as a whole, the results are then put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. This statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign to produce the same number of values as the writable expressions on the left-hand side; while iterating, the statement assigns each of the values produced on the right to the corresponding expression on the left.\\nPython has a \"string format\" operator % that functions analogously to printf format strings in the C language—e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this operator was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g., \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": spam = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f\\'spam={spam} eggs={eggs}\\'.\\nStrings in Python can be concatenated by \"adding\" them (using the same operator as for adding integers and floats); e.g., \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". If strings contain numbers, they are concatenated as strings rather than as integers, e.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\".\\nPython supports string literals in several ways:\\nDelimited by single or double quotation marks; single and double quotation marks have equivalent functionality (unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages). Both marks use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".\\nTriple-quoted, i.e., starting and ending with three single or double quotation marks; this may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby.\\nRaw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as in regular expressions and Windows-style paths. (Compare \"@-quoting\" in C#.)\\nPython has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, which are written as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The (optional) third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped or reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted—for example, a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\\nIn Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This distinction leads to duplicating some functionality, for example:\\n\\nList comprehensions vs. for-loops\\nConditional expressions vs. if blocks\\nThe eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former function is for expressions, while the latter is for statements\\nA statement cannot be part of an expression; because of this restriction, expressions such as list and dict comprehensions (and lambda expressions) cannot contain statements. As a particular case, an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot be part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement.\\n\\n\\n=== Typing ===\\n\\nPython uses duck typing, and it has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at definition time; rather, operations on an object may fail at usage time, indicating that the object is not of an appropriate type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are poorly defined (e.g., adding a number and a string) rather than quietly attempting to interpret them.\\nPython allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class, for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()); the classes are instances of the metaclass type (which is an instance of itself), thereby allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\\nBefore version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes, both using the same syntax: old-style and new-style. Current Python versions support the semantics of only the new style.\\nPython supports optional type annotations. These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors. Python includes a module typing including several type names for type annotations. Also, Mypy supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.\\n\\n\\n=== Arithmetic operations ===\\nPython includes conventional symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor-division operator //, and the modulo operator %. (With the modulo operator, a remainder can be negative, e.g., 4 % -3 == -2.) Also, Python offers the ** symbol for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0. Also, it offers the matrix‑multiplication operator @ . These operators work as in traditional mathematics; with the same precedence rules, the infix operators + and - can also be unary, to represent positive and negative numbers respectively.\\nDivision between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:\\n\\nThe current version of Python (i.e., since 3.0) changed the / operator to always represent floating-point division, e.g., 5/2 == 2.5.\\nThe floor division // operator was introduced, meaning that 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0, and -7.5//3 == -3.0. For Python 2.7, adding the from __future__ import division statement allows a module in Python 2.7 to use Python 3.x rules for division (see above).\\nIn Python terms, the / operator represents true division (or simply division), while the // operator represents floor division. Before version 3.0, the / operator represents classic division.\\nRounding towards negative infinity, though a different method than in most languages, adds consistency to Python. For instance, this rounding implies that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. Also, the rounding implies that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. As expected, the result of a%b lies in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer; however, maintaining the validity of the equation requires that the result must lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.\\nPython provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses the round to even method: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2. Python versions before 3 used the round-away-from-zero method: round(0.5) is 1.0, and round(-0.5) is −1.0.\\nPython allows Boolean expressions that contain multiple equality relations to be consistent with general usage in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.\\nPython uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision with several rounding modes. The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.\\nDue to Python\\'s extensive mathematics library and the third-party library NumPy, the language is frequently used for scientific scripting in tasks such as numerical data processing and manipulation.\\n\\n\\n=== Function syntax ===\\nFunctions are created in Python by using the def keyword. A function is defined similarly to how it is called, by first providing the function name and then the required parameters. Here is an example of a function that prints its inputs:\\n\\nTo assign a default value to a function parameter in case no actual value is provided at run time, variable-definition syntax can be used inside the function header.\\n\\n\\n== Code examples ==\\n\"Hello, World!\" program:\\n\\nProgram to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer:\\n\\n\\n== Libraries ==\\nPython\\'s large standard library is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. The language includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\\nSome parts of the standard library are covered by specifications—for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333—but most parts are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules must be altered or rewritten for variant implementations.\\nAs of 13 March 2025, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 614,339 packages.\\n\\n\\n== Development environments ==\\n\\nMost Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL); this permits the environment to function as a command line interpreter, with which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately.\\nAlso, CPython is bundled with an integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE, which is oriented toward beginners.\\nOther shells, including IDLE and IPython, add additional capabilities such as improved auto-completion, session-state retention, and syntax highlighting.\\nStandard desktop IDEs include PyCharm, Spyder, and Visual Studio Code; there are web browser-based IDEs, such as the following environments:\\n\\nJupyter Notebooks, an open-source interactive computing platform;\\nPythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and\\nCanopy, a commercial IDE from Enthought that emphasizes scientific computing.\\n\\n\\n== Implementations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Reference implementation ===\\nCPython is the reference implementation of Python. This implementation is written in C, meeting the C11 standard since version 3.11. Older versions use the C89 standard with several select C99 features, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions—e.g., they can be implemented using C11 or C++. CPython compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode, which is then executed by a virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a combination of C and native Python.\\nCPython is available for many platforms, including Windows and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, using an experimental installer). Starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer intentionally fails to install on Windows 7 and 8; Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5, with unofficial support for VMS. Platform portability was one of Python\\'s earliest priorities. During development of Python 1 and 2, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported; since that time, support has been dropped for many platforms.\\nAll current Python versions (since 3.7) support only operating systems that feature multithreading, by now supporting not nearly as many operating systems (dropping many outdated) than in the past.\\n\\n\\n=== Limitations of the reference implementation ===\\nThe energy usage of Python with CPython for typically written code is much worse than C by a factor of 75.88.\\nThe throughput of Python with CPython for typically written code is worse than C by a factor of 71.9.\\nThe average memory usage of CPython for typically written code is worse than C by a factor of 2.4.\\n\\n\\n=== Other implementations ===\\nAll alternative implementations have at least slightly different semantics. For example, an alternative may include unordered dictionaries, in contrast to other current Python versions. As another example in the larger Python ecosystem, PyPy does not support the full C Python API.\\nCreating an executable with Python often is done by bundling an entire Python interpreter into the executable, which causes binary sizes to be massive for small programs, yet there exist implementations that are capable of truly compiling Python. Alternative implementations include the following:\\n\\nPyPy is a faster, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and  3.10. PyPy\\'s just-in-time compiler often improves speed significantly relative to CPython, but PyPy does not support some libraries written in C. PyPy offers support for the RISC-V instruction-set architecture.\\nCodon is an implementation with an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler, which compiles a statically-typed Python-like language whose \"syntax and semantics are nearly identical to Python\\'s, there are some notable differences\" For example, Codon uses 64-bit machine integers for speed, not arbitrarily as with Python; Codon developers claim that speedups over CPython are usually on the order of ten to a hundred times. Codon compiles to machine code (via LLVM) and supports native multithreading.  Codon can also compile to Python extension modules that can be imported and used from Python.\\nMicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants that are optimized for microcontrollers, including the Lego Mindstorms EV3.\\nPyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up execution of Python programs.\\nCinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that features a number of optimizations, including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT, and an experimental bytecode compiler.\\nThe Snek embedded computing language \"is Python-inspired, but it is not Python. It is possible to write Snek programs that run under a full Python system, but most Python programs will not run under Snek.\" Snek is compatible with 8-bit AVR microcontrollers such as ATmega 328P-based Arduino, as well as larger microcontrollers that are compatible with MicroPython. Snek is an imperative language that (unlike Python) omits object-oriented programming. Snek supports only one numeric data type, which features 32-bit single precision (resembling JavaScript numbers, though smaller).\\n\\n\\n=== Unsupported implementations ===\\nStackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads. This implementation uses the call stack differently, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also offers a stackless version.\\nJust-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:\\n\\nGoogle began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009: this project aimed to speed up the Python interpreter five-fold by using LLVM, and improve multithreading capability for scaling to thousands of cores, while typical implementations are limited by the global interpreter lock.\\nPsyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler, which integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later.\\nPyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones, which was released by Nokia in 2005. The interpreter implemented many modules from Python\\'s standard library, as well as additional modules for integration with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python through the GTK widget library, allowing programs to be written and run on the target device.\\n\\n\\n=== Transpilers to other languages ===\\nThere are several compilers/transpilers to high-level object languages; the source language is unrestricted Python, a subset of Python, or a language similar to Python:\\n\\nBrython and Transcrypt compile Python to JavaScript.\\nCython compiles a superset of Python to C. The resulting code can be used with Python via direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\\nPyJL compiles/transpiles a subset of Python to \"human-readable, maintainable, and high-performance Julia source code\". Despite the developers\\' performance claims, this is not possible for arbitrary Python code; that is, compiling to a faster language or machine code is known to be impossible in the general case. The semantics of Python might potentially be changed, but in many cases speedup is possible with few or no changes in the Python code. The faster Julia source code can then be used from Python or compiled to machine code.\\nNuitka compiles Python into C. This compiler works with Python 3.4 to 3.13 (and 2.6 and 2.7) for Python\\'s main supported platforms (and Windows 7 or even Windows XP) and for Android. The compiler developers claim full support for Python 3.10, partial support for Python 3.11 and 3.12,  and experimental support for Python 3.13. Nuitka supports macOS including Apple Silicon-based versions.  The compiler is free of cost, though it has commercial add-ons (e.g., for hiding source code).\\nNumba is a JIT compiler that is used from Python; the compiler translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. This tool is enabled by adding a decorator to the relevant Python code.\\nPythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++11).\\nRPython can be compiled to C, and it is used to build the PyPy interpreter for Python.\\nThe Python → 11l → C++ transpiler compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++17).\\nThere are also specialized compilers:\\n\\nMyHDL is a Python-based hardware description language (HDL) that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code.\\nSome older projects existed, as well as compilers not designed for use with Python 3.x and related syntax:\\n\\nGoogle\\'s Grumpy transpiles Python 2 to Go. The latest release was in 2017.\\nIronPython allows running Python 2.7 programs with the .NET Common Language Runtime. An alpha version (released in 2021), is available for \"Python 3.4, although features and behaviors from later versions may be included.\"\\nJython compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of Java libraries from a Python program.\\nPyrex (last released in 2010) and Shed Skin (last released in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively.\\n\\n\\n=== Performance ===\\nA performance comparison among various Python implementations, using a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload, was presented at EuroSciPy \\'13. In addition, Python\\'s performance relative to other programming languages is benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.\\nThere are several approaches to optimizing Python performance, despite the inherent slowness of an interpreted language. These approaches include the following strategies or tools:\\n\\nJust-in-time compilation: Dynamically compiling parts of a Python program during the execution of the program. This technique is used in libraries such as Numba and PyPy.\\nStatic compilation: Sometimes, Python code can be compiled into machine code sometime before execution. An example of this approach is Cython, which compiles Python into C.\\nConcurrency and parallelism: Multiple tasks can be run simultaneously. Python contains modules such as `multiprocessing` to support this form of parallelism. Moreover, this approach helps to overcome limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPU tasks.\\nEfficient data structures: Performance can also be improved by using data types such as Set for membership tests, or deque from collections for queue operations.\\nPerformance gains can be observed by utilizing libraries such as NumPy. Most high performance Python libraries use C or Fortran under the hood instead of the Python interpreter.\\n\\n\\n== Language Development ==\\nPython\\'s development is conducted mostly through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process; this process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP 8. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.\\nEnhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language\\'s development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted by the foundation. In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub. Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.\\nCPython\\'s public releases have three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:\\n\\nBackward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and must be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 will probably never exist.\\nMajor or \"feature\" releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9, these releases are expected to occur annually. Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release.\\nBug fix releases, which introduce no new features, occur approximately every three months; these releases are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.\\nMany alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for releases, they are often delayed if the code is not ready yet. Python\\'s development team monitors the state of the code by running a large unit test suite during development.\\nThe major academic conference on Python is PyCon. Also, there are special Python mentoring programs, such as PyLadies.\\n\\n\\n== Naming ==\\nPython\\'s name is inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs, rather than the traditional foo and bar. Also, the official Python documentation contains various references to Monty Python routines. Python users are sometimes referred to as \"Pythonistas\".\\n\\n\\n== Languages influenced by Python ==\\nCobra has an Acknowledgements document that lists Python first among influencing languages.\\nECMAScript and JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python.\\nGo is designed for \"speed of working in a dynamic language like Python\".\\nJulia was designed to be \"as usable for general programming as Python\".\\nMojo is almost a superset of Python.\\nGDScript is strongly influenced by Python. \\n Groovy, Boo, CoffeeScript, F#, Nim, Ring, Ruby, Swift, and V have been influenced, as well.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of Python programming books\\npip (package manager)\\nPydoc\\nNumPy\\nSciPy\\nJupyter\\nPytorch\\nCython\\nCPython\\nMojo\\nPygame\\nPyQt\\nPyGTK\\nPyPy\\nPyCon\\nGoogle Colab –  zero setup online IDE that runs Python\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\n\"Python for Artificial Intelligence\".

      "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.\n",
      "Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5, capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing. Currently only versions in the 3.x series are supported. \n",
      "Python has gained widespread use in the machine learning community. It is widely taught as an introductory programming language. Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.\n",

      "== History ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Python implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from responsibilities as Python's \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. (He has since come out of retirement and is self-titled \"BDFL-emeritus\".) In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.\n",
      "The name Python derives from the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus. (See § Naming.)\n",
      "Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, featuring many new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, and then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. It no longer receives security patches or updates. While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e., \"2.7.18+\" (plus 3.11), with the plus signifying (at least some) \"backported security updates\".\n",
      "Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, and was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions, with some new semantics and changed syntax. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. Several releases in the Python 3.x series have added new syntax to the language, and made a few (considered very minor) backward-incompatible changes.\n",
      "As of November 2025, Python 3.14.0 is the latest stable release, and Python 3.13.9 was released a week later, all older 3.x versions had a security update down to Python 3.9.24 then again with 3.9.25, the final version in 3.9 series. Python 3.10 is, since November 2025, the oldest supported branch. Python 3.15 has an alpha released, and Android has a official downloadable executable available for Python 3.14. Releases receive two years of full support followed by three years of security support.\n",

      "== Design philosophy and features ==\n",
      "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming – including metaprogramming and metaobjects. Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python is often referred to as a 'glue language' because it is purposely designed to be able to integrate components written in other languages.\n",
      "Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\n",
      "Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp tradition\". It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.\n",
      "Python's core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20) written by Tim Peters, which includes aphorisms such as these:\n",
      "\n",
      "Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
      "Simple is better than complex.\n",
      "Readability counts.\n",
      "Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n",
      "Although practicality beats purity.\n",
      "Errors should never pass silently.\n",
      "Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
      "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n",
      "However, Python has received criticism for violating these principles and adding unnecessary language bloat. Responses to these criticisms note that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. The addition of some new features had been controversial: Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life after conflict about adding the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8 .\n",
      "Nevertheless, rather than building all functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which represented the opposite approach.\n",
      "Python claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar, while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. Python lacks do while loops, which Rossum considered harmful. In contrast to Perl's motto \"there is more than one way to do it\", Python advocates an approach where \"there should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it\". In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve a given goal. There are at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use. Alex Martelli is a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author; he wrote that \"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"\n",
      "Python's developers typically prioritise readability over performance. For example, they reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer increases in speed that do not justify the cost of clarity and readability. Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. Also, it is possible to transpile to other languages. However, this approach either fails to achieve the expected speed-up, since Python is a very dynamic language, or only a restricted subset of Python is compiled (with potential minor semantic changes).\n",
      "Python is meant to be a fun language to use. This goal is reflected in the name – a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python – and in playful approaches to some tutorials and reference materials. For instance, some code examples use the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (in reference to a Monty Python sketch), rather than the typical terms \"foo\" and \"bar\".\n",
      "A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a broad range of meanings related to program style: Pythonic code may use Python idioms well; be natural or show fluency in the language; or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Syntax and semantics ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Indentation ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Statements and control flow ===\n",
      "Python's statements include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "The assignment statement, using a single equals sign =\n",
      "The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else if)\n",
      "The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a variable for use by the attached block; the variable is not deleted when the loop finishes\n",
      "The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as boolean condition is true\n",
      "The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses (or new syntax except* in Python 3.11 for exception groups); the try statement also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits\n",
      "The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception\n",
      "The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming\n",
      "The def statement, which defines a function or method\n",
      "The with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager, allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom Examples of a context include acquiring a lock before some code is run, and then releasing the lock; or opening and then closing a file\n",
      "The break statement, which exits a loop\n",
      "The continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next\n",
      "The del statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined \n",
      "The pass statement, serving as a NOP (i.e., no operation), which is syntactically needed to create an empty code block\n",
      "The assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply\n",
      "The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines\n",
      "The return statement, used to return a value from a function\n",
      "The import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program\n",
      "The match and case statements, analogous to a switch statement construct, which compares an expression against one or more cases as a control-flow measure\n",
      "The assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\n",
      "Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations; according to Van Rossum, the language never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, data can be passed through multiple stack levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Expressions ===\n",
      "Python's expressions include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "The +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of division in Python: floor division (or integer division) //, and floating-point division /. Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation.\n",
      "Python uses the + operator for string concatenation. The language uses the * operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times.\n",
      "The @ infix operator is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.\n",
      "The syntax :=, called the \"walrus operator\", was introduced in Python 3.8. This operator assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.\n",
      "In Python, == compares two objects by value. Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (i.e., comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, a <= b <= c.\n",
      "Python uses and, or, and not as Boolean operators.\n",
      "Python has a type of expression called a list comprehension, and a more general expression called a generator expression.\n",
      "Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body.\n",
      "Conditional expressions are written as x if c else y. (This is different in operand order from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages.)\n",
      "Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (since dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided that all of the tuple's elements are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. For example, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); this result is then assigned back to t—thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.\n",
      "Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to something assignable (e.g., a variable or a writable property) are associated just as in forming tuple literal; as a whole, the results are then put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. This statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign to produce the same number of values as the writable expressions on the left-hand side; while iterating, the statement assigns each of the values produced on the right to the corresponding expression on the left.\n",
      "Python has a \"string format\" operator % that functions analogously to printf format strings in the C language—e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this operator was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g., \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": spam = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f'spam={spam} eggs={eggs}'.\n",
      "Strings in Python can be concatenated by \"adding\" them (using the same operator as for adding integers and floats); e.g., \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". If strings contain numbers, they are concatenated as strings rather than as integers, e.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\".\n",
      "Python supports string literals in several ways:\n",
      "Delimited by single or double quotation marks; single and double quotation marks have equivalent functionality (unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages). Both marks use the backslash (\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".\n",
      "Triple-quoted, i.e., starting and ending with three single or double quotation marks; this may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby.\n",
      "Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as in regular expressions and Windows-style paths. (Compare \"@-quoting\" in C#.)\n",
      "Python has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, which are written as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The (optional) third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped or reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted—for example, a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\n",
      "In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This distinction leads to duplicating some functionality, for example:\n",
      "\n",
      "List comprehensions vs. for-loops\n",
      "Conditional expressions vs. if blocks\n",
      "The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former function is for expressions, while the latter is for statements\n",
      "A statement cannot be part of an expression; because of this restriction, expressions such as list and dict comprehensions (and lambda expressions) cannot contain statements. As a particular case, an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot be part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Typing ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Python uses duck typing, and it has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at definition time; rather, operations on an object may fail at usage time, indicating that the object is not of an appropriate type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are poorly defined (e.g., adding a number and a string) rather than quietly attempting to interpret them.\n",
      "Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class, for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()); the classes are instances of the metaclass type (which is an instance of itself), thereby allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\n",
      "Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes, both using the same syntax: old-style and new-style. Current Python versions support the semantics of only the new style.\n",
      "Python supports optional type annotations. These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors. Python includes a module typing including several type names for type annotations. Also, Mypy supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Arithmetic operations ===\n",
      "Python includes conventional symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor-division operator //, and the modulo operator %. (With the modulo operator, a remainder can be negative, e.g., 4 % -3 == -2.) Also, Python offers the ** symbol for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0. Also, it offers the matrix‑multiplication operator @ . These operators work as in traditional mathematics; with the same precedence rules, the infix operators + and - can also be unary, to represent positive and negative numbers respectively.\n",
      "Division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:\n",
      "\n",
      "The current version of Python (i.e., since 3.0) changed the / operator to always represent floating-point division, e.g., 5/2 == 2.5.\n",
      "The floor division // operator was introduced, meaning that 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0, and -7.5//3 == -3.0. For Python 2.7, adding the from __future__ import division statement allows a module in Python 2.7 to use Python 3.x rules for division (see above).\n",
      "In Python terms, the / operator represents true division (or simply division), while the // operator represents floor division. Before version 3.0, the / operator represents classic division.\n",
      "Rounding towards negative infinity, though a different method than in most languages, adds consistency to Python. For instance, this rounding implies that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. Also, the rounding implies that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. As expected, the result of a%b lies in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer; however, maintaining the validity of the equation requires that the result must lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.\n",
      "Python provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses the round to even method: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2. Python versions before 3 used the round-away-from-zero method: round(0.5) is 1.0, and round(-0.5) is −1.0.\n",
      "Python allows Boolean expressions that contain multiple equality relations to be consistent with general usage in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.\n",
      "Python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision with several rounding modes. The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.\n",
      "Due to Python's extensive mathematics library and the third-party library NumPy, the language is frequently used for scientific scripting in tasks such as numerical data processing and manipulation.\n",
      "\n",

      "Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications—for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333—but most parts are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules must be altered or rewritten for variant implementations.\n",

      "CPython is the reference implementation of Python. This implementation is written in C, meeting the C11 standard since version 3.11. Older versions use the C89 standard with several select C99 features, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions—e.g., they can be implemented using C11 or C++. CPython compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode, which is then executed by a virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a combination of C and native Python.\n",
      "CPython is available for many platforms, including Windows and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, using an experimental installer). Starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer intentionally fails to install on Windows 7 and 8; Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5, with unofficial support for VMS. Platform portability was one of Python's earliest priorities. During development of Python 1 and 2, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported; since that time, support has been dropped for many platforms.\n",

      "Creating an executable with Python often is done by bundling an entire Python interpreter into the executable, which causes binary sizes to be massive for small programs, yet there exist implementations that are capable of truly compiling Python. Alternative implementations include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "PyPy is a faster, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and  3.10. PyPy's just-in-time compiler often improves speed significantly relative to CPython, but PyPy does not support some libraries written in C. PyPy offers support for the RISC-V instruction-set architecture.\n",
      "Codon is an implementation with an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler, which compiles a statically-typed Python-like language whose \"syntax and semantics are nearly identical to Python's, there are some notable differences\" For example, Codon uses 64-bit machine integers for speed, not arbitrarily as with Python; Codon developers claim that speedups over CPython are usually on the order of ten to a hundred times. Codon compiles to machine code (via LLVM) and supports native multithreading.  Codon can also compile to Python extension modules that can be imported and used from Python.\n",
      "MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants that are optimized for microcontrollers, including the Lego Mindstorms EV3.\n",

It is possible to write Snek programs that run under a full Python system, but most Python programs will not run under Snek.\" Snek is compatible with 8-bit AVR microcontrollers such as ATmega 328P-based Arduino, as well as larger microcontrollers that are compatible with MicroPython. Snek is an imperative language that (unlike Python) omits object-oriented programming.

The semantics of Python might potentially be changed, but in many cases speedup is possible with few or no changes in the Python code. The faster Julia source code can then be used from Python or compiled to machine code.\n",

      "Just-in-time compilation: Dynamically compiling parts of a Python program during the execution of the program. This technique is used in libraries such as Numba and PyPy.\n",
      "Static compilation: Sometimes, Python code can be compiled into machine code sometime before execution. An example of this approach is Cython, which compiles Python into C.\n",
      "Concurrency and parallelism: Multiple tasks can be run simultaneously. Python contains modules such as `multiprocessing` to support this form of parallelism. Moreover, this approach helps to overcome limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPU tasks.\n",
      "Efficient data structures: Performance can also be improved by using data types such as Set for membership tests, or deque from collections for queue operations.\n",
      "Performance gains can be observed by utilizing libraries such as NumPy. Most high performance Python libraries use C or Fortran under the hood instead of the Python interpreter.\n",
      "\n",

      "== Language Development ==\n",
      "Python's development is conducted mostly through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process; this process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP 8. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.\n",
      "Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted by the foundation. In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub. Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.\n",

      "Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and must be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 will probably never exist.\n",
      "Major or \"feature\" releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9, these releases are expected to occur annually. Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release.\n",
      "Bug fix releases, which introduce no new features, occur approximately every three months; these releases are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.\n",
      "Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for releases, they are often delayed if the code is not ready yet. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running a large unit test suite during development.\n",

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.\\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5, capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing. Currently only versions in the 3.x series are supported. \\nPython has gained widespread use in the machine learning community. It is widely taught as an introductory programming language. Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Python implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from responsibilities as Python\\'s \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker. (He has since come out of retirement and is self-titled \"BDFL-emeritus\".) In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.\\nThe name Python derives from the British comedy series Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus. (See § Naming.)\\nPython 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, featuring many new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 2.7\\'s end-of-life was initially set for 2015, and then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. It no longer receives security patches or updates. While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e., \"2.7.18+\" (plus 3.11), with the plus signifying (at least some) \"backported security updates\".\\nPython 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, and was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions, with some new semantics and changed syntax. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. Several releases in the Python 3.x series have added new syntax to the language, and made a few (considered very minor) backward-incompatible changes.\\nAs of November 2025, Python 3.14.0 is the latest stable release, and Python 3.13.9 was released a week later, all older 3.x versions had a security update down to Python 3.9.24 then again with 3.9.25, the final version in 3.9 series. Python 3.10 is, since November 2025, the oldest supported branch. Python 3.15 has an alpha released, and Android has a official downloadable executable available for Python 3.14. Releases receive two years of full support followed by three years of security support.\\n\\n\\n== Design philosophy and features ==\\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming – including metaprogramming and metaobjects. Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python is often referred to as a \\'glue language\\' because it is purposely designed to be able to integrate components written in other languages.\\nPython uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\\nPython\\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp tradition\". It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.\\nPython\\'s core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20) written by Tim Peters, which includes aphorisms such as these:\\n\\nExplicit is better than implicit.\\nSimple is better than complex.\\nReadability counts.\\nSpecial cases aren\\'t special enough to break the rules.\\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\\nErrors should never pass silently.\\nUnless explicitly silenced.\\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\\nHowever, Python has received criticism for violating these principles and adding unnecessary language bloat. Responses to these criticisms note that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. The addition of some new features had been controversial: Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life after conflict about adding the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8\\u2009.\\nNevertheless, rather than building all functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum\\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which represented the opposite approach.\\nPython claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar, while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. Python lacks do while loops, which Rossum considered harmful. In contrast to Perl\\'s motto \"there is more than one way to do it\", Python advocates an approach where \"there should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it\". In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve a given goal. There are at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use. Alex Martelli is a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author; he wrote that \"To describe something as \\'clever\\' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"\\nPython\\'s developers typically prioritise readability over performance. For example, they reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer increases in speed that do not justify the cost of clarity and readability. Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. Also, it is possible to transpile to other languages. However, this approach either fails to achieve the expected speed-up, since Python is a very dynamic language, or only a restricted subset of Python is compiled (with potential minor semantic changes).\\nPython is meant to be a fun language to use. This goal is reflected in the name – a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python – and in playful approaches to some tutorials and reference materials. For instance, some code examples use the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (in reference to a Monty Python sketch), rather than the typical terms \"foo\" and \"bar\".\\nA common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a broad range of meanings related to program style: Pythonic code may use Python idioms well; be natural or show fluency in the language; or conform with Python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability.\\n\\n\\n== Syntax and semantics ==\\n\\nPython is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.\\n\\n\\n=== Indentation ===\\n\\nPython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program\\'s visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.\\n\\n\\n=== Statements and control flow ===\\nPython\\'s statements include the following:\\n\\nThe assignment statement, using a single equals sign =\\nThe if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else if)\\nThe for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a variable for use by the attached block; the variable is not deleted when the loop finishes\\nThe while statement, which executes a block of code as long as boolean condition is true\\nThe try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses (or new syntax except* in Python 3.11 for exception groups); the try statement also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits\\nThe raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception\\nThe class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming\\nThe def statement, which defines a function or method\\nThe with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager, allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom Examples of a context include acquiring a lock before some code is run, and then releasing the lock; or opening and then closing a file\\nThe break statement, which exits a loop\\nThe continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next\\nThe del statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined \\nThe pass statement, serving as a NOP (i.e., no operation), which is syntactically needed to create an empty code block\\nThe assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply\\nThe yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines\\nThe return statement, used to return a value from a function\\nThe import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program\\nThe match and case statements, analogous to a switch statement construct, which compares an expression against one or more cases as a control-flow measure\\nThe assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\\nPython does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations; according to Van Rossum, the language never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python\\'s generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, data can be passed through multiple stack levels.\\n\\n\\n=== Expressions ===\\nPython\\'s expressions include the following:\\n\\nThe +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of division in Python: floor division (or integer division) //, and floating-point division /. Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation.\\nPython uses the + operator for string concatenation. The language uses the * operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times.\\nThe @ infix operator is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.\\nThe syntax :=, called the \"walrus operator\", was introduced in Python 3.8. This operator assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.\\nIn Python, == compares two objects by value. Python\\'s is operator may be used to compare object identities (i.e., comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, a <= b <= c.\\nPython uses and, or, and not as Boolean operators.\\nPython has a type of expression called a list comprehension, and a more general expression called a generator expression.\\nAnonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body.\\nConditional expressions are written as x if c else y. (This is different in operand order from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages.)\\nPython makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (since dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided that all of the tuple\\'s elements are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. For example, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); this result is then assigned back to t—thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.\\nPython features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to something assignable (e.g., a variable or a writable property) are associated just as in forming tuple literal; as a whole, the results are then put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. This statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign to produce the same number of values as the writable expressions on the left-hand side; while iterating, the statement assigns each of the values produced on the right to the corresponding expression on the left.\\nPython has a \"string format\" operator % that functions analogously to printf format strings in the C language—e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this operator was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g., \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": spam = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f\\'spam={spam} eggs={eggs}\\'.\\nStrings in Python can be concatenated by \"adding\" them (using the same operator as for adding integers and floats); e.g., \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". If strings contain numbers, they are concatenated as strings rather than as integers, e.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\".\\nPython supports string literals in several ways:\\nDelimited by single or double quotation marks; single and double quotation marks have equivalent functionality (unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages). Both marks use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".\\nTriple-quoted, i.e., starting and ending with three single or double quotation marks; this may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby.\\nRaw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as in regular expressions and Windows-style paths. (Compare \"@-quoting\" in C#.)\\nPython has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, which are written as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The (optional) third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped or reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted—for example, a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\\nIn Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This distinction leads to duplicating some functionality, for example:\\n\\nList comprehensions vs. for-loops\\nConditional expressions vs. if blocks\\nThe eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former function is for expressions, while the latter is for statements\\nA statement cannot be part of an expression; because of this restriction, expressions such as list and dict comprehensions (and lambda expressions) cannot contain statements. As a particular case, an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot be part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement.\\n\\n\\n=== Typing ===\\n\\nPython uses duck typing, and it has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at definition time; rather, operations on an object may fail at usage time, indicating that the object is not of an appropriate type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are poorly defined (e.g., adding a number and a string) rather than quietly attempting to interpret them.\\nPython allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class, for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()); the classes are instances of the metaclass type (which is an instance of itself), thereby allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\\nBefore version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes, both using the same syntax: old-style and new-style. Current Python versions support the semantics of only the new style.\\nPython supports optional type annotations. These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors. Python includes a module typing including several type names for type annotations. Also, Mypy supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.\\n\\n\\n=== Arithmetic operations ===\\nPython includes conventional symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor-division operator //, and the modulo operator %. (With the modulo operator, a remainder can be negative, e.g., 4 % -3 == -2.) Also, Python offers the ** symbol for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0. Also, it offers the matrix‑multiplication operator @ . These operators work as in traditional mathematics; with the same precedence rules, the infix operators + and - can also be unary, to represent positive and negative numbers respectively.\\nDivision between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:\\n\\nThe current version of Python (i.e., since 3.0) changed the / operator to always represent floating-point division, e.g., 5/2 == 2.5.\\nThe floor division // operator was introduced, meaning that 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0, and -7.5//3 == -3.0. For Python 2.7, adding the from __future__ import division statement allows a module in Python 2.7 to use Python 3.x rules for division (see above).\\nIn Python terms, the / operator represents true division (or simply division), while the // operator represents floor division. Before version 3.0, the / operator represents classic division.\\nRounding towards negative infinity, though a different method than in most languages, adds consistency to Python. For instance, this rounding implies that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. Also, the rounding implies that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. As expected, the result of a%b lies in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer; however, maintaining the validity of the equation requires that the result must lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.\\nPython provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses the round to even method: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2. Python versions before 3 used the round-away-from-zero method: round(0.5) is 1.0, and round(-0.5) is −1.0.\\nPython allows Boolean expressions that contain multiple equality relations to be consistent with general usage in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.\\nPython uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision with several rounding modes. The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.\\nDue to Python\\'s extensive mathematics library and the third-party library NumPy, the language is frequently used for scientific scripting in tasks such as numerical data processing and manipulation.\\n\\n\\n=== Function syntax ===\\nFunctions are created in Python by using the def keyword. A function is defined similarly to how it is called, by first providing the function name and then the required parameters. Here is an example of a function that prints its inputs:\\n\\nTo assign a default value to a function parameter in case no actual value is provided at run time, variable-definition syntax can be used inside the function header.\\n\\n\\n== Code examples ==\\n\"Hello, World!\" program:\\n\\nProgram to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer:\\n\\n\\n== Libraries ==\\nPython\\'s large standard library is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. The language includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\\nSome parts of the standard library are covered by specifications—for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333—but most parts are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules must be altered or rewritten for variant implementations.\\nAs of 13 March 2025, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 614,339 packages.\\n\\n\\n== Development environments ==\\n\\nMost Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL); this permits the environment to function as a command line interpreter, with which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately.\\nAlso, CPython is bundled with an integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE, which is oriented toward beginners.\\nOther shells, including IDLE and IPython, add additional capabilities such as improved auto-completion, session-state retention, and syntax highlighting.\\nStandard desktop IDEs include PyCharm, Spyder, and Visual Studio Code; there are web browser-based IDEs, such as the following environments:\\n\\nJupyter Notebooks, an open-source interactive computing platform;\\nPythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and\\nCanopy, a commercial IDE from Enthought that emphasizes scientific computing.\\n\\n\\n== Implementations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Reference implementation ===\\nCPython is the reference implementation of Python. This implementation is written in C, meeting the C11 standard since version 3.11. Older versions use the C89 standard with several select C99 features, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions—e.g., they can be implemented using C11 or C++. CPython compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode, which is then executed by a virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a combination of C and native Python.\\nCPython is available for many platforms, including Windows and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, using an experimental installer). Starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer intentionally fails to install on Windows 7 and 8; Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5, with unofficial support for VMS. Platform portability was one of Python\\'s earliest priorities. During development of Python 1 and 2, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported; since that time, support has been dropped for many platforms.\\nAll current Python versions (since 3.7) support only operating systems that feature multithreading, by now supporting not nearly as many operating systems (dropping many outdated) than in the past.\\n\\n\\n=== Limitations of the reference implementation ===\\nThe energy usage of Python with CPython for typically written code is much worse than C by a factor of 75.88.\\nThe throughput of Python with CPython for typically written code is worse than C by a factor of 71.9.\\nThe average memory usage of CPython for typically written code is worse than C by a factor of 2.4.\\n\\n\\n=== Other implementations ===\\nAll alternative implementations have at least slightly different semantics. For example, an alternative may include unordered dictionaries, in contrast to other current Python versions. As another example in the larger Python ecosystem, PyPy does not support the full C Python API.\\nCreating an executable with Python often is done by bundling an entire Python interpreter into the executable, which causes binary sizes to be massive for small programs, yet there exist implementations that are capable of truly compiling Python. Alternative implementations include the following:\\n\\nPyPy is a faster, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and  3.10. PyPy\\'s just-in-time compiler often improves speed significantly relative to CPython, but PyPy does not support some libraries written in C. PyPy offers support for the RISC-V instruction-set architecture.\\nCodon is an implementation with an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler, which compiles a statically-typed Python-like language whose \"syntax and semantics are nearly identical to Python\\'s, there are some notable differences\" For example, Codon uses 64-bit machine integers for speed, not arbitrarily as with Python; Codon developers claim that speedups over CPython are usually on the order of ten to a hundred times. Codon compiles to machine code (via LLVM) and supports native multithreading.  Codon can also compile to Python extension modules that can be imported and used from Python.\\nMicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants that are optimized for microcontrollers, including the Lego Mindstorms EV3.\\nPyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up execution of Python programs.\\nCinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that features a number of optimizations, including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT, and an experimental bytecode compiler.\\nThe Snek embedded computing language \"is Python-inspired, but it is not Python. It is possible to write Snek programs that run under a full Python system, but most Python programs will not run under Snek.\" Snek is compatible with 8-bit AVR microcontrollers such as ATmega 328P-based Arduino, as well as larger microcontrollers that are compatible with MicroPython. Snek is an imperative language that (unlike Python) omits object-oriented programming. Snek supports only one numeric data type, which features 32-bit single precision (resembling JavaScript numbers, though smaller).\\n\\n\\n=== Unsupported implementations ===\\nStackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads. This implementation uses the call stack differently, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also offers a stackless version.\\nJust-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:\\n\\nGoogle began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009: this project aimed to speed up the Python interpreter five-fold by using LLVM, and improve multithreading capability for scaling to thousands of cores, while typical implementations are limited by the global interpreter lock.\\nPsyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler, which integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later.\\nPyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones, which was released by Nokia in 2005. The interpreter implemented many modules from Python\\'s standard library, as well as additional modules for integration with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python through the GTK widget library, allowing programs to be written and run on the target device.\\n\\n\\n=== Transpilers to other languages ===\\nThere are several compilers/transpilers to high-level object languages; the source language is unrestricted Python, a subset of Python, or a language similar to Python:\\n\\nBrython and Transcrypt compile Python to JavaScript.\\nCython compiles a superset of Python to C. The resulting code can be used with Python via direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\\nPyJL compiles/transpiles a subset of Python to \"human-readable, maintainable, and high-performance Julia source code\". Despite the developers\\' performance claims, this is not possible for arbitrary Python code; that is, compiling to a faster language or machine code is known to be impossible in the general case. The semantics of Python might potentially be changed, but in many cases speedup is possible with few or no changes in the Python code. The faster Julia source code can then be used from Python or compiled to machine code.\\nNuitka compiles Python into C. This compiler works with Python 3.4 to 3.13 (and 2.6 and 2.7) for Python\\'s main supported platforms (and Windows 7 or even Windows XP) and for Android. The compiler developers claim full support for Python 3.10, partial support for Python 3.11 and 3.12,  and experimental support for Python 3.13. Nuitka supports macOS including Apple Silicon-based versions.  The compiler is free of cost, though it has commercial add-ons (e.g., for hiding source code).\\nNumba is a JIT compiler that is used from Python; the compiler translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. This tool is enabled by adding a decorator to the relevant Python code.\\nPythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++11).\\nRPython can be compiled to C, and it is used to build the PyPy interpreter for Python.\\nThe Python → 11l → C++ transpiler compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++17).\\nThere are also specialized compilers:\\n\\nMyHDL is a Python-based hardware description language (HDL) that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code.\\nSome older projects existed, as well as compilers not designed for use with Python 3.x and related syntax:\\n\\nGoogle\\'s Grumpy transpiles Python 2 to Go. The latest release was in 2017.\\nIronPython allows running Python 2.7 programs with the .NET Common Language Runtime. An alpha version (released in 2021), is available for \"Python 3.4, although features and behaviors from later versions may be included.\"\\nJython compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of Java libraries from a Python program.\\nPyrex (last released in 2010) and Shed Skin (last released in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively.\\n\\n\\n=== Performance ===\\nA performance comparison among various Python implementations, using a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload, was presented at EuroSciPy \\'13. In addition, Python\\'s performance relative to other programming languages is benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.\\nThere are several approaches to optimizing Python performance, despite the inherent slowness of an interpreted language. These approaches include the following strategies or tools:\\n\\nJust-in-time compilation: Dynamically compiling parts of a Python program during the execution of the program. This technique is used in libraries such as Numba and PyPy.\\nStatic compilation: Sometimes, Python code can be compiled into machine code sometime before execution. An example of this approach is Cython, which compiles Python into C.\\nConcurrency and parallelism: Multiple tasks can be run simultaneously. Python contains modules such as `multiprocessing` to support this form of parallelism. Moreover, this approach helps to overcome limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPU tasks.\\nEfficient data structures: Performance can also be improved by using data types such as Set for membership tests, or deque from collections for queue operations.\\nPerformance gains can be observed by utilizing libraries such as NumPy. Most high performance Python libraries use C or Fortran under the hood instead of the Python interpreter.\\n\\n\\n== Language Development ==\\nPython\\'s development is conducted mostly through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process; this process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP 8. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.\\nEnhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language\\'s development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted by the foundation. In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub. Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.\\nCPython\\'s public releases have three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:\\n\\nBackward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and must be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 will probably never exist.\\nMajor or \"feature\" releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9, these releases are expected to occur annually. Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release.\\nBug fix releases, which introduce no new features, occur approximately every three months; these releases are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.\\nMany alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for releases, they are often delayed if the code is not ready yet. Python\\'s development team monitors the state of the code by running a large unit test suite during development.\\nThe major academic conference on Python is PyCon. Also, there are special Python mentoring programs, such as PyLadies.\\n\\n\\n== Naming ==\\nPython\\'s name is inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs, rather than the traditional foo and bar. Also, the official Python documentation contains various references to Monty Python routines. Python users are sometimes referred to as \"Pythonistas\".\\n\\n\\n== Languages influenced by Python ==\\nCobra has an Acknowledgements document that lists Python first among influencing languages.\\nECMAScript and JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python.\\nGo is designed for \"speed of working in a dynamic language like Python\".\\nJulia was designed to be \"as usable for general programming as Python\".\\nMojo is almost a superset of Python.\\nGDScript is strongly influenced by Python. \\n Groovy, Boo, CoffeeScript, F#, Nim, Ring, Ruby, Swift, and V have been influenced, as well.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of Python programming books\\npip (package manager)\\nPydoc\\nNumPy\\nSciPy\\nJupyter\\nPytorch\\nCython\\nCPython\\nMojo\\nPygame\\nPyQt\\nPyGTK\\nPyPy\\nPyCon\\nGoogle Colab –  zero setup online IDE that runs Python\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\n\"Python for Artificial Intelligence\".

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.\\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5, capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing. Currently only versions in the 3.x series are supported. \\nPython has gained widespread use in the machine learning community. It is widely taught as an introductory programming language. Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Python implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from responsibilities as Python\\'s \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker. (He has since come out of retirement and is self-titled \"BDFL-emeritus\".) In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.\\nThe name Python derives from the British comedy series Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus. (See § Naming.)\\nPython 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, featuring many new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 2.7\\'s end-of-life was initially set for 2015, and then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. It no longer receives security patches or updates. While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e., \"2.7.18+\" (plus 3.11), with the plus signifying (at least some) \"backported security updates\".\\nPython 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, and was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions, with some new semantics and changed syntax. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. Several releases in the Python 3.x series have added new syntax to the language, and made a few (considered very minor) backward-incompatible changes.\\nAs of November 2025, Python 3.14.0 is the latest stable release, and Python 3.13.9 was released a week later, all older 3.x versions had a security update down to Python 3.9.24 then again with 3.9.25, the final version in 3.9 series. Python 3.10 is, since November 2025, the oldest supported branch. Python 3.15 has an alpha released, and Android has a official downloadable executable available for Python 3.14. Releases receive two years of full support followed by three years of security support.\\n\\n\\n== Design philosophy and features ==\\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming – including metaprogramming and metaobjects. Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python is often referred to as a \\'glue language\\' because it is purposely designed to be able to integrate components written in other languages.\\nPython uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\\nPython\\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp tradition\". It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.\\nPython\\'s core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20) written by Tim Peters, which includes aphorisms such as these:\\n\\nExplicit is better than implicit.\\nSimple is better than complex.\\nReadability counts.\\nSpecial cases aren\\'t special enough to break the rules.\\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\\nErrors should never pass silently.\\nUnless explicitly silenced.\\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\\nHowever, Python has received criticism for violating these principles and adding unnecessary language bloat. Responses to these criticisms note that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. The addition of some new features had been controversial: Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life after conflict about adding the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8\\u2009.\\nNevertheless, rather than building all functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum\\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which represented the opposite approach.\\nPython claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar, while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. Python lacks do while loops, which Rossum considered harmful. In contrast to Perl\\'s motto \"there is more than one way to do it\", Python advocates an approach where \"there should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it\". In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve a given goal. There are at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use. Alex Martelli is a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author; he wrote that \"To describe something as \\'clever\\' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"\\nPython\\'s developers typically prioritise readability over performance. For example, they reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer increases in speed that do not justify the cost of clarity and readability. Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. Also, it is possible to transpile to other languages. However, this approach either fails to achieve the expected speed-up, since Python is a very dynamic language, or only a restricted subset of Python is compiled (with potential minor semantic changes).\\nPython is meant to be a fun language to use. This goal is reflected in the name – a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python – and in playful approaches to some tutorials and reference materials. For instance, some code examples use the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (in reference to a Monty Python sketch), rather than the typical terms \"foo\" and \"bar\".\\nA common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a broad range of meanings related to program style: Pythonic code may use Python idioms well; be natural or show fluency in the language; or conform with Python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability.\\n\\n\\n== Syntax and semantics ==\\n\\nPython is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.\\n\\n\\n=== Indentation ===\\n\\nPython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program\\'s visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.\\n\\n\\n=== Statements and control flow ===\\nPython\\'s statements include the following:\\n\\nThe assignment statement, using a single equals sign =\\nThe if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else if)\\nThe for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a variable for use by the attached block; the variable is not deleted when the loop finishes\\nThe while statement, which executes a block of code as long as boolean condition is true\\nThe try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses (or new syntax except* in Python 3.11 for exception groups); the try statement also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits\\nThe raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception\\nThe class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming\\nThe def statement, which defines a function or method\\nThe with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager, allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom Examples of a context include acquiring a lock before some code is run, and then releasing the lock; or opening and then closing a file\\nThe break statement, which exits a loop\\nThe continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next\\nThe del statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined \\nThe pass statement, serving as a NOP (i.e., no operation), which is syntactically needed to create an empty code block\\nThe assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply\\nThe yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines\\nThe return statement, used to return a value from a function\\nThe import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program\\nThe match and case statements, analogous to a switch statement construct, which compares an expression against one or more cases as a control-flow measure\\nThe assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\\nPython does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations; according to Van Rossum, the language never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python\\'s generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, data can be passed through multiple stack levels.\\n\\n\\n=== Expressions ===\\nPython\\'s expressions include the following:\\n\\nThe +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of division in Python: floor division (or integer division) //, and floating-point division /. Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation.\\nPython uses the + operator for string concatenation. The language uses the * operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times.\\nThe @ infix operator is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.\\nThe syntax :=, called the \"walrus operator\", was introduced in Python 3.8. This operator assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.\\nIn Python, == compares two objects by value. Python\\'s is operator may be used to compare object identities (i.e., comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, a <= b <= c.\\nPython uses and, or, and not as Boolean operators.\\nPython has a type of expression called a list comprehension, and a more general expression called a generator expression.\\nAnonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body.\\nConditional expressions are written as x if c else y. (This is different in operand order from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages.)\\nPython makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (since dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided that all of the tuple\\'s elements are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. For example, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); this result is then assigned back to t—thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.\\nPython features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to something assignable (e.g., a variable or a writable property) are associated just as in forming tuple literal; as a whole, the results are then put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. This statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign to produce the same number of values as the writable expressions on the left-hand side; while iterating, the statement assigns each of the values produced on the right to the corresponding expression on the left.\\nPython has a \"string format\" operator % that functions analogously to printf format strings in the C language—e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this operator was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g., \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": spam = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f\\'spam={spam} eggs={eggs}\\'.\\nStrings in Python can be concatenated by \"adding\" them (using the same operator as for adding integers and floats); e.g., \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". If strings contain numbers, they are concatenated as strings rather than as integers, e.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\".\\nPython supports string literals in several ways:\\nDelimited by single or double quotation marks; single and double quotation marks have equivalent functionality (unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages). Both marks use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".\\nTriple-quoted, i.e., starting and ending with three single or double quotation marks; this may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby.\\nRaw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as in regular expressions and Windows-style paths. (Compare \"@-quoting\" in C#.)\\nPython has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, which are written as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The (optional) third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped or reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted—for example, a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\\nIn Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This distinction leads to duplicating some functionality, for example:\\n\\nList comprehensions vs. for-loops\\nConditional expressions vs. if blocks\\nThe eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former function is for expressions, while the latter is for statements\\nA statement cannot be part of an expression; because of this restriction, expressions such as list and dict comprehensions (and lambda expressions) cannot contain statements. As a particular case, an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot be part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement.\\n\\n\\n=== Typing ===\\n\\nPython uses duck typing, and it has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at definition time; rather, operations on an object may fail at usage time, indicating that the object is not of an appropriate type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are poorly defined (e.g., adding a number and a string) rather than quietly attempting to interpret them.\\nPython allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class, for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()); the classes are instances of the metaclass type (which is an instance of itself), thereby allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\\nBefore version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes, both using the same syntax: old-style and new-style. Current Python versions support the semantics of only the new style.\\nPython supports optional type annotations. These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors. Python includes a module typing including several type names for type annotations. Also, Mypy supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.\\n\\n\\n=== Arithmetic operations ===\\nPython includes conventional symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor-division operator //, and the modulo operator %. (With the modulo operator, a remainder can be negative, e.g., 4 % -3 == -2.) Also, Python offers the ** symbol for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0. Also, it offers the matrix‑multiplication operator @ . These operators work as in traditional mathematics; with the same precedence rules, the infix operators + and - can also be unary, to represent positive and negative numbers respectively.\\nDivision between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:\\n\\nThe current version of Python (i.e., since 3.0) changed the / operator to always represent floating-point division, e.g., 5/2 == 2.5.\\nThe floor division // operator was introduced, meaning that 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0, and -7.5//3 == -3.0. For Python 2.7, adding the from __future__ import division statement allows a module in Python 2.7 to use Python 3.x rules for division (see above).\\nIn Python terms, the / operator represents true division (or simply division), while the // operator represents floor division. Before version 3.0, the / operator represents classic division.\\nRounding towards negative infinity, though a different method than in most languages, adds consistency to Python. For instance, this rounding implies that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. Also, the rounding implies that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. As expected, the result of a%b lies in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer; however, maintaining the validity of the equation requires that the result must lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.\\nPython provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses the round to even method: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2. Python versions before 3 used the round-away-from-zero method: round(0.5) is 1.0, and round(-0.5) is −1.0.\\nPython allows Boolean expressions that contain multiple equality relations to be consistent with general usage in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.\\nPython uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision with several rounding modes. The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.\\nDue to Python\\'s extensive mathematics library and the third-party library NumPy, the language is frequently used for scientific scripting in tasks such as numerical data processing and manipulation.\\n\\n\\n=== Function syntax ===\\nFunctions are created in Python by using the def keyword. A function is defined similarly to how it is called, by first providing the function name and then the required parameters. Here is an example of a function that prints its inputs:\\n\\nTo assign a default value to a function parameter in case no actual value is provided at run time, variable-definition syntax can be used inside the function header.\\n\\n\\n== Code examples ==\\n\"Hello, World!\" program:\\n\\nProgram to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer:\\n\\n\\n== Libraries ==\\nPython\\'s large standard library is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. The language includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\\nSome parts of the standard library are covered by specifications—for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333—but most parts are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules must be altered or rewritten for variant implementations.\\nAs of 13 March 2025, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 614,339 packages.\\n\\n\\n== Development environments ==\\n\\nMost Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL); this permits the environment to function as a command line interpreter, with which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately.\\nAlso, CPython is bundled with an integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE, which is oriented toward beginners.\\nOther shells, including IDLE and IPython, add additional capabilities such as improved auto-completion, session-state retention, and syntax highlighting.\\nStandard desktop IDEs include PyCharm, Spyder, and Visual Studio Code; there are web browser-based IDEs, such as the following environments:\\n\\nJupyter Notebooks, an open-source interactive computing platform;\\nPythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and\\nCanopy, a commercial IDE from Enthought that emphasizes scientific computing.\\n\\n\\n== Implementations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Reference implementation ===\\nCPython is the reference implementation of Python. This implementation is written in C, meeting the C11 standard since version 3.11. Older versions use the C89 standard with several select C99 features, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions—e.g., they can be implemented using C11 or C++. CPython compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode, which is then executed by a virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a combination of C and native Python.\\nCPython is available for many platforms, including Windows and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, using an experimental installer). Starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer intentionally fails to install on Windows 7 and 8; Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5, with unofficial support for VMS. Platform portability was one of Python\\'s earliest priorities. During development of Python 1 and 2, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported; since that time, support has been dropped for many platforms.\\nAll current Python versions (since 3.7) support only operating systems that feature multithreading, by now supporting not nearly as many operating systems (dropping many outdated) than in the past.\\n\\n\\n=== Limitations of the reference implementation ===\\nThe energy usage of Python with CPython for typically written code is much worse than C by a factor of 75.88.\\nThe throughput of Python with CPython for typically written code is worse than C by a factor of 71.9.\\nThe average memory usage of CPython for typically written code is worse than C by a factor of 2.4.\\n\\n\\n=== Other implementations ===\\nAll alternative implementations have at least slightly different semantics. For example, an alternative may include unordered dictionaries, in contrast to other current Python versions. As another example in the larger Python ecosystem, PyPy does not support the full C Python API.\\nCreating an executable with Python often is done by bundling an entire Python interpreter into the executable, which causes binary sizes to be massive for small programs, yet there exist implementations that are capable of truly compiling Python. Alternative implementations include the following:\\n\\nPyPy is a faster, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and  3.10. PyPy\\'s just-in-time compiler often improves speed significantly relative to CPython, but PyPy does not support some libraries written in C. PyPy offers support for the RISC-V instruction-set architecture.\\nCodon is an implementation with an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler, which compiles a statically-typed Python-like language whose \"syntax and semantics are nearly identical to Python\\'s, there are some notable differences\" For example, Codon uses 64-bit machine integers for speed, not arbitrarily as with Python; Codon developers claim that speedups over CPython are usually on the order of ten to a hundred times. Codon compiles to machine code (via LLVM) and supports native multithreading.  Codon can also compile to Python extension modules that can be imported and used from Python.\\nMicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants that are optimized for microcontrollers, including the Lego Mindstorms EV3.\\nPyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up execution of Python programs.\\nCinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that features a number of optimizations, including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT, and an experimental bytecode compiler.\\nThe Snek embedded computing language \"is Python-inspired, but it is not Python. It is possible to write Snek programs that run under a full Python system, but most Python programs will not run under Snek.\" Snek is compatible with 8-bit AVR microcontrollers such as ATmega 328P-based Arduino, as well as larger microcontrollers that are compatible with MicroPython. Snek is an imperative language that (unlike Python) omits object-oriented programming. Snek supports only one numeric data type, which features 32-bit single precision (resembling JavaScript numbers, though smaller).\\n\\n\\n=== Unsupported implementations ===\\nStackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads. This implementation uses the call stack differently, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also offers a stackless version.\\nJust-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:\\n\\nGoogle began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009: this project aimed to speed up the Python interpreter five-fold by using LLVM, and improve multithreading capability for scaling to thousands of cores, while typical implementations are limited by the global interpreter lock.\\nPsyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler, which integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later.\\nPyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones, which was released by Nokia in 2005. The interpreter implemented many modules from Python\\'s standard library, as well as additional modules for integration with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python through the GTK widget library, allowing programs to be written and run on the target device.\\n\\n\\n=== Transpilers to other languages ===\\nThere are several compilers/transpilers to high-level object languages; the source language is unrestricted Python, a subset of Python, or a language similar to Python:\\n\\nBrython and Transcrypt compile Python to JavaScript.\\nCython compiles a superset of Python to C. The resulting code can be used with Python via direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\\nPyJL compiles/transpiles a subset of Python to \"human-readable, maintainable, and high-performance Julia source code\". Despite the developers\\' performance claims, this is not possible for arbitrary Python code; that is, compiling to a faster language or machine code is known to be impossible in the general case. The semantics of Python might potentially be changed, but in many cases speedup is possible with few or no changes in the Python code. The faster Julia source code can then be used from Python or compiled to machine code.\\nNuitka compiles Python into C. This compiler works with Python 3.4 to 3.13 (and 2.6 and 2.7) for Python\\'s main supported platforms (and Windows 7 or even Windows XP) and for Android. The compiler developers claim full support for Python 3.10, partial support for Python 3.11 and 3.12,  and experimental support for Python 3.13. Nuitka supports macOS including Apple Silicon-based versions.  The compiler is free of cost, though it has commercial add-ons (e.g., for hiding source code).\\nNumba is a JIT compiler that is used from Python; the compiler translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. This tool is enabled by adding a decorator to the relevant Python code.\\nPythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++11).\\nRPython can be compiled to C, and it is used to build the PyPy interpreter for Python.\\nThe Python → 11l → C++ transpiler compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++17).\\nThere are also specialized compilers:\\n\\nMyHDL is a Python-based hardware description language (HDL) that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code.\\nSome older projects existed, as well as compilers not designed for use with Python 3.x and related syntax:\\n\\nGoogle\\'s Grumpy transpiles Python 2 to Go. The latest release was in 2017.\\nIronPython allows running Python 2.7 programs with the .NET Common Language Runtime. An alpha version (released in 2021), is available for \"Python 3.4, although features and behaviors from later versions may be included.\"\\nJython compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of Java libraries from a Python program.\\nPyrex (last released in 2010) and Shed Skin (last released in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively.\\n\\n\\n=== Performance ===\\nA performance comparison among various Python implementations, using a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload, was presented at EuroSciPy \\'13. In addition, Python\\'s performance relative to other programming languages is benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.\\nThere are several approaches to optimizing Python performance, despite the inherent slowness of an interpreted language. These approaches include the following strategies or tools:\\n\\nJust-in-time compilation: Dynamically compiling parts of a Python program during the execution of the program. This technique is used in libraries such as Numba and PyPy.\\nStatic compilation: Sometimes, Python code can be compiled into machine code sometime before execution. An example of this approach is Cython, which compiles Python into C.\\nConcurrency and parallelism: Multiple tasks can be run simultaneously. Python contains modules such as `multiprocessing` to support this form of parallelism. Moreover, this approach helps to overcome limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPU tasks.\\nEfficient data structures: Performance can also be improved by using data types such as Set for membership tests, or deque from collections for queue operations.\\nPerformance gains can be observed by utilizing libraries such as NumPy. Most high performance Python libraries use C or Fortran under the hood instead of the Python interpreter.\\n\\n\\n== Language Development ==\\nPython\\'s development is conducted mostly through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process; this process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP 8. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.\\nEnhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language\\'s development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted by the foundation. In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub. Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.\\nCPython\\'s public releases have three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:\\n\\nBackward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and must be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 will probably never exist.\\nMajor or \"feature\" releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9, these releases are expected to occur annually. Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release.\\nBug fix releases, which introduce no new features, occur approximately every three months; these releases are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.\\nMany alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for releases, they are often delayed if the code is not ready yet. Python\\'s development team monitors the state of the code by running a large unit test suite during development.\\nThe major academic conference on Python is PyCon. Also, there are special Python mentoring programs, such as PyLadies.\\n\\n\\n== Naming ==\\nPython\\'s name is inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs, rather than the traditional foo and bar.

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.\\nGuido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Beginning with Python 3.5, capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing. Currently only versions in the 3.x series are supported. \\nPython has gained widespread use in the machine learning community. It is widely taught as an introductory programming language. Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Python implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from responsibilities as Python\\'s \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project\\'s chief decision-maker. (He has since come out of retirement and is self-titled \"BDFL-emeritus\".) In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.\\nThe name Python derives from the British comedy series Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus. (See § Naming.)\\nPython 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, featuring many new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 2.7\\'s end-of-life was initially set for 2015, and then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. It no longer receives security patches or updates. While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e., \"2.7.18+\" (plus 3.11), with the plus signifying (at least some) \"backported security updates\".\\nPython 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, and was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions, with some new semantics and changed syntax. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. Several releases in the Python 3.x series have added new syntax to the language, and made a few (considered very minor) backward-incompatible changes.\\nAs of November 2025, Python 3.14.0 is the latest stable release, and Python 3.13.9 was released a week later, all older 3.x versions had a security update down to Python 3.9.24 then again with 3.9.25, the final version in 3.9 series. Python 3.10 is, since November 2025, the oldest supported branch. Python 3.15 has an alpha released, and Android has a official downloadable executable available for Python 3.14. Releases receive two years of full support followed by three years of security support.\\n\\n\\n== Design philosophy and features ==\\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming – including metaprogramming and metaobjects. Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python is often referred to as a \\'glue language\\' because it is purposely designed to be able to integrate components written in other languages.\\nPython uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\\nPython\\'s design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp tradition\". It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.\\nPython\\'s core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20) written by Tim Peters, which includes aphorisms such as these:\\n\\nExplicit is better than implicit.\\nSimple is better than complex.\\nReadability counts.\\nSpecial cases aren\\'t special enough to break the rules.\\nAlthough practicality beats purity.\\nErrors should never pass silently.\\nUnless explicitly silenced.\\nThere should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\\nHowever, Python has received criticism for violating these principles and adding unnecessary language bloat. Responses to these criticisms note that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. The addition of some new features had been controversial: Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life after conflict about adding the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8\\u2009.\\nNevertheless, rather than building all functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum\\'s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which represented the opposite approach.\\nPython claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar, while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. Python lacks do while loops, which Rossum considered harmful. In contrast to Perl\\'s motto \"there is more than one way to do it\", Python advocates an approach where \"there should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it\". In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve a given goal. There are at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use. Alex Martelli is a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author; he wrote that \"To describe something as \\'clever\\' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"\\nPython\\'s developers typically prioritise readability over performance. For example, they reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer increases in speed that do not justify the cost of clarity and readability. Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. Also, it is possible to transpile to other languages. However, this approach either fails to achieve the expected speed-up, since Python is a very dynamic language, or only a restricted subset of Python is compiled (with potential minor semantic changes).\\nPython is meant to be a fun language to use. This goal is reflected in the name – a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python – and in playful approaches to some tutorials and reference materials. For instance, some code examples use the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (in reference to a Monty Python sketch), rather than the typical terms \"foo\" and \"bar\".\\nA common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a broad range of meanings related to program style: Pythonic code may use Python idioms well; be natural or show fluency in the language; or conform with Python\\'s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability.\\n\\n\\n== Syntax and semantics ==\\n\\nPython is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.\\n\\n\\n=== Indentation ===\\n\\nPython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program\\'s visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.\\n\\n\\n=== Statements and control flow ===\\nPython\\'s statements include the following:\\n\\nThe assignment statement, using a single equals sign =\\nThe if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else if)\\nThe for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a variable for use by the attached block; the variable is not deleted when the loop finishes\\nThe while statement, which executes a block of code as long as boolean condition is true\\nThe try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses (or new syntax except* in Python 3.11 for exception groups); the try statement also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block is always run regardless of how the block exits\\nThe raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception\\nThe class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming\\nThe def statement, which defines a function or method\\nThe with statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager, allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom Examples of a context include acquiring a lock before some code is run, and then releasing the lock; or opening and then closing a file\\nThe break statement, which exits a loop\\nThe continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next\\nThe del statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined \\nThe pass statement, serving as a NOP (i.e., no operation), which is syntactically needed to create an empty code block\\nThe assert statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply\\nThe yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines\\nThe return statement, used to return a value from a function\\nThe import and from statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program\\nThe match and case statements, analogous to a switch statement construct, which compares an expression against one or more cases as a control-flow measure\\nThe assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\\nPython does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations; according to Van Rossum, the language never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python\\'s generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, data can be passed through multiple stack levels.\\n\\n\\n=== Expressions ===\\nPython\\'s expressions include the following:\\n\\nThe +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of division in Python: floor division (or integer division) //, and floating-point division /. Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation.\\nPython uses the + operator for string concatenation. The language uses the * operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times.\\nThe @ infix operator is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.\\nThe syntax :=, called the \"walrus operator\", was introduced in Python 3.8. This operator assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.\\nIn Python, == compares two objects by value. Python\\'s is operator may be used to compare object identities (i.e., comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, a <= b <= c.\\nPython uses and, or, and not as Boolean operators.\\nPython has a type of expression called a list comprehension, and a more general expression called a generator expression.\\nAnonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body.\\nConditional expressions are written as x if c else y. (This is different in operand order from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages.)\\nPython makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (since dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided that all of the tuple\\'s elements are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. For example, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); this result is then assigned back to t—thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.\\nPython features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to something assignable (e.g., a variable or a writable property) are associated just as in forming tuple literal; as a whole, the results are then put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. This statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign to produce the same number of values as the writable expressions on the left-hand side; while iterating, the statement assigns each of the values produced on the right to the corresponding expression on the left.\\nPython has a \"string format\" operator % that functions analogously to printf format strings in the C language—e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this operator was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g., \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": spam = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f\\'spam={spam} eggs={eggs}\\'.\\nStrings in Python can be concatenated by \"adding\" them (using the same operator as for adding integers and floats); e.g., \"spam\" + \"eggs\" returns \"spameggs\". If strings contain numbers, they are concatenated as strings rather than as integers, e.g. \"2\" + \"2\" returns \"22\".\\nPython supports string literals in several ways:\\nDelimited by single or double quotation marks; single and double quotation marks have equivalent functionality (unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages). Both marks use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".\\nTriple-quoted, i.e., starting and ending with three single or double quotation marks; this may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby.\\nRaw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as in regular expressions and Windows-style paths. (Compare \"@-quoting\" in C#.)\\nPython has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, which are written as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The (optional) third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped or reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted—for example, a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\\nIn Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This distinction leads to duplicating some functionality, for example:\\n\\nList comprehensions vs. for-loops\\nConditional expressions vs. if blocks\\nThe eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former function is for expressions, while the latter is for statements\\nA statement cannot be part of an expression; because of this restriction, expressions such as list and dict comprehensions (and lambda expressions) cannot contain statements. As a particular case, an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot be part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement.\\n\\n\\n=== Typing ===\\n\\nPython uses duck typing, and it has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at definition time; rather, operations on an object may fail at usage time, indicating that the object is not of an appropriate type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are poorly defined (e.g., adding a number and a string) rather than quietly attempting to interpret them.\\nPython allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class, for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()); the classes are instances of the metaclass type (which is an instance of itself), thereby allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\\nBefore version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes, both using the same syntax: old-style and new-style. Current Python versions support the semantics of only the new style.\\nPython supports optional type annotations. These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors. Python includes a module typing including several type names for type annotations. Also, Mypy supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.\\n\\n\\n=== Arithmetic operations ===\\nPython includes conventional symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), the floor-division operator //, and the modulo operator %. (With the modulo operator, a remainder can be negative, e.g., 4 % -3 == -2.) Also, Python offers the ** symbol for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0. Also, it offers the matrix‑multiplication operator @ . These operators work as in traditional mathematics; with the same precedence rules, the infix operators + and - can also be unary, to represent positive and negative numbers respectively.\\nDivision between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:\\n\\nThe current version of Python (i.e., since 3.0) changed the / operator to always represent floating-point division, e.g., 5/2 == 2.5.\\nThe floor division // operator was introduced, meaning that 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0, and -7.5//3 == -3.0. For Python 2.7, adding the from __future__ import division statement allows a module in Python 2.7 to use Python 3.x rules for division (see above).\\nIn Python terms, the / operator represents true division (or simply division), while the // operator represents floor division. Before version 3.0, the / operator represents classic division.\\nRounding towards negative infinity, though a different method than in most languages, adds consistency to Python. For instance, this rounding implies that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1 is always true. Also, the rounding implies that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. As expected, the result of a%b lies in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer; however, maintaining the validity of the equation requires that the result must lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.\\nPython provides a round function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses the round to even method: round(1.5) and round(2.5) both produce 2. Python versions before 3 used the round-away-from-zero method: round(0.5) is 1.0, and round(-0.5) is −1.0.\\nPython allows Boolean expressions that contain multiple equality relations to be consistent with general usage in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.\\nPython uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal type/class in the decimal module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision with several rounding modes. The Fraction class in the fractions module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.\\nDue to Python\\'s extensive mathematics library and the third-party library NumPy, the language is frequently used for scientific scripting in tasks such as numerical data processing and manipulation.\\n\\n\\n=== Function syntax ===\\nFunctions are created in Python by using the def keyword. A function is defined similarly to how it is called, by first providing the function name and then the required parameters. Here is an example of a function that prints its inputs:\\n\\nTo assign a default value to a function parameter in case no actual value is provided at run time, variable-definition syntax can be used inside the function header.\\n\\n\\n== Code examples ==\\n\"Hello, World!\" program:\\n\\nProgram to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer:\\n\\n\\n== Libraries ==\\nPython\\'s large standard library is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. The language includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\\nSome parts of the standard library are covered by specifications—for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333—but most parts are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules must be altered or rewritten for variant implementations.\\nAs of 13 March 2025, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 614,339 packages.\\n\\n\\n== Development environments ==\\n\\nMost Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL); this permits the environment to function as a command line interpreter, with which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately.\\nAlso, CPython is bundled with an integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE, which is oriented toward beginners.\\nOther shells, including IDLE and IPython, add additional capabilities such as improved auto-completion, session-state retention, and syntax highlighting.\\nStandard desktop IDEs include PyCharm, Spyder, and Visual Studio Code; there are web browser-based IDEs, such as the following environments:\\n\\nJupyter Notebooks, an open-source interactive computing platform;\\nPythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and\\nCanopy, a commercial IDE from Enthought that emphasizes scientific computing.\\n\\n\\n== Implementations ==\\n\\n\\n=== Reference implementation ===\\nCPython is the reference implementation of Python. This implementation is written in C, meeting the C11 standard since version 3.11. Older versions use the C89 standard with several select C99 features, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions—e.g., they can be implemented using C11 or C++. CPython compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode, which is then executed by a virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a combination of C and native Python.\\nCPython is available for many platforms, including Windows and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, using an experimental installer). Starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer intentionally fails to install on Windows 7 and 8; Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5, with unofficial support for VMS. Platform portability was one of Python\\'s earliest priorities. During development of Python 1 and 2, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported; since that time, support has been dropped for many platforms.\\nAll current Python versions (since 3.7) support only operating systems that feature multithreading, by now supporting not nearly as many operating systems (dropping many outdated) than in the past.\\n\\n\\n=== Limitations of the reference implementation ===\\nThe energy usage of Python with CPython for typically written code is much worse than C by a factor of 75.88.\\nThe throughput of Python with CPython for typically written code is worse than C by a factor of 71.9.\\nThe average memory usage of CPython for typically written code is worse than C by a factor of 2.4.\\n\\n\\n=== Other implementations ===\\nAll alternative implementations have at least slightly different semantics. For example, an alternative may include unordered dictionaries, in contrast to other current Python versions. As another example in the larger Python ecosystem, PyPy does not support the full C Python API.\\nCreating an executable with Python often is done by bundling an entire Python interpreter into the executable, which causes binary sizes to be massive for small programs, yet there exist implementations that are capable of truly compiling Python. Alternative implementations include the following:\\n\\nPyPy is a faster, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and  3.10. PyPy\\'s just-in-time compiler often improves speed significantly relative to CPython, but PyPy does not support some libraries written in C. PyPy offers support for the RISC-V instruction-set architecture.\\nCodon is an implementation with an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler, which compiles a statically-typed Python-like language whose \"syntax and semantics are nearly identical to Python\\'s, there are some notable differences\" For example, Codon uses 64-bit machine integers for speed, not arbitrarily as with Python; Codon developers claim that speedups over CPython are usually on the order of ten to a hundred times. Codon compiles to machine code (via LLVM) and supports native multithreading.  Codon can also compile to Python extension modules that can be imported and used from Python.\\nMicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants that are optimized for microcontrollers, including the Lego Mindstorms EV3.\\nPyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up execution of Python programs.\\nCinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that features a number of optimizations, including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT, and an experimental bytecode compiler.\\nThe Snek embedded computing language \"is Python-inspired, but it is not Python. It is possible to write Snek programs that run under a full Python system, but most Python programs will not run under Snek.\" Snek is compatible with 8-bit AVR microcontrollers such as ATmega 328P-based Arduino, as well as larger microcontrollers that are compatible with MicroPython. Snek is an imperative language that (unlike Python) omits object-oriented programming. Snek supports only one numeric data type, which features 32-bit single precision (resembling JavaScript numbers, though smaller).\\n\\n\\n=== Unsupported implementations ===\\nStackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads. This implementation uses the call stack differently, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also offers a stackless version.\\nJust-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:\\n\\nGoogle began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009: this project aimed to speed up the Python interpreter five-fold by using LLVM, and improve multithreading capability for scaling to thousands of cores, while typical implementations are limited by the global interpreter lock.\\nPsyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler, which integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later.\\nPyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones, which was released by Nokia in 2005. The interpreter implemented many modules from Python\\'s standard library, as well as additional modules for integration with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python through the GTK widget library, allowing programs to be written and run on the target device.\\n\\n\\n=== Transpilers to other languages ===\\nThere are several compilers/transpilers to high-level object languages; the source language is unrestricted Python, a subset of Python, or a language similar to Python:\\n\\nBrython and Transcrypt compile Python to JavaScript.\\nCython compiles a superset of Python to C. The resulting code can be used with Python via direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\\nPyJL compiles/transpiles a subset of Python to \"human-readable, maintainable, and high-performance Julia source code\". Despite the developers\\' performance claims, this is not possible for arbitrary Python code; that is, compiling to a faster language or machine code is known to be impossible in the general case. The semantics of Python might potentially be changed, but in many cases speedup is possible with few or no changes in the Python code. The faster Julia source code can then be used from Python or compiled to machine code.\\nNuitka compiles Python into C. This compiler works with Python 3.4 to 3.13 (and 2.6 and 2.7) for Python\\'s main supported platforms (and Windows 7 or even Windows XP) and for Android. The compiler developers claim full support for Python 3.10, partial support for Python 3.11 and 3.12,  and experimental support for Python 3.13. Nuitka supports macOS including Apple Silicon-based versions.  The compiler is free of cost, though it has commercial add-ons (e.g., for hiding source code).\\nNumba is a JIT compiler that is used from Python; the compiler translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code.

The latest release was in 2017.\\nIronPython allows running Python 2.7 programs with the .NET Common Language Runtime.

In addition, Python\\'s performance relative to other programming languages is benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.\\nThere are several approaches to optimizing Python performance, despite the inherent slowness of an interpreted language. These approaches include the following strategies or tools:\\n\\nJust-in-time compilation: Dynamically compiling parts of a Python program during the execution of the program. This technique is used in libraries such as Numba and PyPy.\\nStatic compilation: Sometimes, Python code can be compiled into machine code sometime before execution. An example of this approach is Cython, which compiles Python into C.\\nConcurrency and parallelism: Multiple tasks can be run simultaneously. Python contains modules such as `multiprocessing` to support this form of parallelism. Moreover, this approach helps to overcome limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPU tasks.\\nEfficient data structures: Performance can also be improved by using data types such as Set for membership tests, or deque from collections for queue operations.\\nPerformance gains can be observed by utilizing libraries such as NumPy. Most high performance Python libraries use C or Fortran under the hood instead of the Python interpreter.\\n\\n\\n== Language Development ==\\nPython\\'s development is conducted mostly through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process; this process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP 8. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.\\nEnhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language\\'s development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted by the foundation. In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub. Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.\\nCPython\\'s public releases have three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:\\n\\nBackward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and must be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 will probably never exist.\\nMajor or \"feature\" releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9, these releases are expected to occur annually. Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release.\\nBug fix releases, which introduce no new features, occur approximately every three months; these releases are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.\\nMany alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for releases, they are often delayed if the code is not ready yet. Python\\'s development team monitors the state of the code by running a large unit test suite during development.\\nThe major academic conference on Python is PyCon. Also, there are special Python mentoring programs, such as PyLadies.\\n\\n\\n== Naming ==\\nPython\\'s name is inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs, rather than the traditional foo and bar. Also, the official Python documentation contains various references to Monty Python routines. Python users are sometimes referred to as \"Pythonistas\".\\n\\n\\n== Languages influenced by Python ==\\nCobra has an Acknowledgements document that lists Python first among influencing languages.\\nECMAScript and JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python.\\nGo is designed for \"speed of working in a dynamic language like Python\".\\nJulia was designed to be \"as usable for general programming as Python\".\\nMojo is almost a superset of Python.\\nGDScript is strongly influenced by Python. \\n Groovy, Boo, CoffeeScript, F#, Nim, Ring, Ruby, Swift, and V have been influenced, as well.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nList of Python programming books\\npip (package manager)\\nPydoc\\nNumPy\\nSciPy\\nJupyter\\nPytorch\\nCython\\nCPython\\nMojo\\nPygame\\nPyQt\\nPyGTK\\nPyPy\\nPyCon\\nGoogle Colab –  zero setup online IDE that runs Python\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\n\"Python for Artificial Intelligence\".

      "[FunctionExecutionResult(content='A carillon (US:  KARR-ə-lon, UK:  kə-RIL-yən) is a pitched percussion instrument that is played with a keyboard and consists of at least 23 bells. The bells are cast in bronze, hung in fixed suspension, and tuned in chromatic order so that they can be sounded harmoniously together. They are struck with clappers connected to a keyboard of wooden batons played with the hands and pedals played with the feet. Often housed in bell towers, carillons are usually owned by churches, universities, or municipalities. They can include an automatic system through which the time is announced and simple tunes are played throughout the day.\\nCarillons come in many designs, weights, sizes, and sounds. They are among the world\\'s heaviest instruments, and the heaviest carillon weighs over 91 metric tons (100 short tons). Most weigh between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons). To be considered a carillon, a minimum of 23 bells is needed; otherwise, it is called a chime. Standard-sized instruments have about 50, and the world\\'s largest has 77 bells. The appearance of  carillons depends on the number and weight of the bells and the tower in which they are housed. They may be found in towers that are free-standing or connected to a building. The bells of a carillon may be directly exposed to the elements or hidden inside the structure of their towers.\\nThe origins of the carillon can be traced to the Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—in the 16th century. The modern carillon was invented in 1644 when Jacob van Eyck and the Hemony brothers cast the first tuned carillon. The instrument experienced a peak until the late 18th century, a decline during the French Revolution, a revival in the late 19th century, a second decline during the First and Second World Wars, and a second revival thereafter. UNESCO has designated 56 belfries in Belgium and France as a World Heritage Site and recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage.\\nAccording to counts by various registries, about 700 carillons exist worldwide. Most are in and around the Low Countries, though nearly 200 have been constructed in North America. Almost all extant carillons were constructed in the 20th century. Additionally, about 500 \"non-traditional\" carillons are known that most registries do not consider to be carillons due to some component of their action being electrified or computerized. A plurality of them is located in the United States, and most of the others are in Western Europe. A few \"traveling\" or \"mobile\" carillons are fixed to a frame that enables them to be transported.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology and terminology ==\\nThe word carillon is a loanword from French dating to the late 18th century. It is derived from Old French carignon (an alteration of quarregon) \\'a set of four bells\\'. The word quarregon originates from Latin quaternionem \\'set of four\\'; from quater \\'four times\\'. The word carillon is often stated to have referred originally to a set of four forestrike bells, whose melodies announced the time signal of public hour bells, but this is not confirmed by archival sources. Some convincing evidence shows that the term referred initially to the medieval custom of chiming on sets of four church bells by pulling the clappers by means of ropes. In German, as well as using the French term, a carillon is sometimes called a Glockenspiel (lit.\\u2009\\'bells set\\'). This should not be confused with the identically named glockenspiel, which itself is sometimes called a carillon in French. Dutch speakers use the word beiaard, which has an uncertain etymology.\\nA musician who plays the carillon is commonly called a carillonneur (US:  KERR-ə-lə-NUR, UK:  kə-RIL-yə-NUR), also lent from French. It and carillon were adopted by English speakers after the introduction of the instrument to British troops following the War of the Spanish Succession in the 18th century. Though the French word carillonneur literally refers to carillon players who are men, the French carillonneuse to denote women is not used in English. Another common term is the English carillonist, which some players of the carillon have wished to replace carillonneur because of the former\\'s gender inclusivity, simple spelling, and unambiguous pronunciation. In 2018, the World Carillon Federation adopted carillonist as the preferred term for its communications.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Construction ===\\n\\nThe carillon is a keyboard instrument. Though it shares similarities with other instruments in this category, such as the organ or pedal piano, its playing console is unique. Playing is done with the player\\'s hands on a manual keyboard composed of rounded, wooden batons. The manual has short chromatic keys (i.e. \"black keys\") raised above the diatonic keys (\"white keys\") and arranged like a piano, but they are spaced far apart, and the chromatic keys are raised above the rest, about 10 cm (4 in). To operate, the keys are depressed with a closed fist. The lowest one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half octaves of the manual are connected to a pedal keyboard played with the feet. The connection is direct, meaning that when a pedal is pressed, its corresponding key on the manual is pulled down with it. Since the mid-20th century, two keyboard design standards have competed for a carillon\\'s console: the North American standard and the North European standard. They differ over several design elements, such as whether the outer pedals curve toward the center or the specific distance a key is depressed. In 2006, the World Carillon Federation developed the WCF Keyboard 2006, which is a compromise between the two standards. The organization recommends that its keyboard standard be used as a guideline when constructing new carillons or renovating existing keyboards.\\n\\nEach key is connected to a transmission system by a wire, usually made of stainless steel. When a particular key is depressed, it pulls on the wire, which after interacting with other wires and pulleys, causes a clapper to swing towards the inner wall of the key\\'s corresponding bell. At rest, these clappers are about 2 to 4 cm (0.8 to 1.6 in) away from the bell wall. Small bells are fitted with springs to pull their clappers back immediately after the stroke, so that the bell is not sounded more than once with each keystroke. This is not necessary for large bells, which have sufficiently heavy clappers. Immediately above each key is a wire adjuster called a turnbuckle. These allow the performer to adjust the length of the wire, which often changes with temperature fluctuations.\\nThe carillon\\'s cast-bronze, cup-shaped bells are housed at the top of a tower in a structure typically made of steel or wooden beams. The arrangement of the bells depends on the space, height, and construction of the tower, and the number and size of bells. When the heaviest bells are especially large, they are usually placed below the playing cabin to achieve a better tonal distribution. The bells do not move during operation, only the clappers. With some instruments, the heaviest bells may be outfitted with a mechanism enabling them to swing.\\n\\n\\n=== Mechanization with clock and playing drum ===\\n\\nCarillons may also feature an automatic mechanism by which simple tunes or the Westminster Quarters are played on the lower bells. The mechanism on European carillons is often a playing drum, which is a large metal cylinder connected to a clock mechanism. Metal pegs are screwed onto the outside of the drum. When the clock mechanism sets the drum in motion, the pegs catch onto levers, connected to hammers that rest just a short distance from the outside of the bell. The hammers are briefly raised, and then fall onto the bell as the peg continues to rotate away from the lever. The pegs are arranged such that simple tunes can be programmed to play at specific quarter hours. In North America, automatic-playing drum systems are not common; instead, carillons may have pneumatic systems, which ring the instrument.\\n\\n\\n=== Sound ===\\n\\nCarillons produce sound by striking stationary bells, categorizing them as percussion idiophones in the Hornbostel–Sachs classification of musical instruments (111.242.222 – sets of bells with internal strikers). Carillon bells are made of bell bronze, a specialized copper–tin alloy used for its above-average rigidity and resonance. A bell\\'s profile (shape) and weight determine its note and the quality of its tone. Therefore, apart from changes in its profile, such as chipping or corrosion, a bell will never lose its original sound. It produces a sound with overtones, also known as partial tones, which are not necessarily harmonically related. To produce a pleasing, harmonically related series of tones, the bell\\'s profile must be carefully adjusted. Bellfounders typically focus on five principal tones when tuning, most notably the minor third overtone called the tierce, which gives rise to the unique sound of carillons and has been the subject of further research, such as the major third bell. Since the casting process does not reliably produce perfectly tuned bells, they are cast slightly thicker and metal is shaved off with a lathe. On older European carillons, bells were tuned with each other using the meantone temperament tuning system. Modern carillons, particularly those in North America, are tuned to equal temperament.\\n\\nThe carillon has a dynamic range similar to a piano, if not more versatile. Through variation of touch, performers can express many volumes. The larger the bell, the larger its dynamic range. Bigger bells will also sound naturally louder than smaller, higher-pitched bells.\\nAlong with pipe organs, carillons are among the world\\'s heaviest musical instruments. Most carillons weigh (counting only the weight of the bells) between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons), with extremes ranging from very light 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) instruments to the world\\'s heaviest at over 91 metric tons (100 short tons)—the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon of the Riverside Church in New York City, US. Its bourdon, or largest bell, is the largest tuned bell ever cast for a carillon. It sounds a full octave below most other bourdons. The entire ensemble of fixed and swinging bells, clappers, and steel framework weighs more than 226 metric tons (249 short tons).\\n\\n\\n=== Range ===\\nA carillon\\'s range is determined by the number of bells it has, which usually depends on funds available for the creation of the instrument; more money allows more bells to be cast, especially the larger, more costly ones. A carillon, as generally accepted, must have a minimum of 23 bells, or else it is called a chime. No standard pitch range for the carillon has been established, so several subcategories are used to categorize them:\\n\\nCarillons with 23 to 27 bells and 35 to 39 bells are classified as two-octave and three-octave carillons, respectively. Players of these instruments often use music written specifically for the limited ranges.\\nA \"concert\" or \"standard\" carillon typically has 45 to 50 bells, or a range of about four octaves.\\nCarillons with more than 50 bells are often referred to as \"great\" or \"grand\" carillons.\\nCarillons of 15 to 22 bells, which were built before 1940, may be classified as \"historical carillons\" by the World Carillon Federation.\\n\\nThe title of \"world\\'s largest carillon by number of bells\" is shared between two instruments: the carillon of the Kirk in the Hills Presbyterian Church in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, US, and the carillon at the Daejeon Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea; both have 77 bells.\\nSince a carillon is seldom played in concert with other instruments, its bourdon may be any pitch—whichever is advantageous for the location and funds available; to simplify the writing and playing of music, keyboards often have a C-compass. As a result, many carillons are transposing instruments, especially those that are small, have many bells, or were constructed on limited funds. The transposition can vary from down a perfect fourth to up an octave. In North America, increasing numbers of new carillons have been installed in concert pitch as a result of the desire to establish the carillon as a full-fledged concert instrument.\\nMany carillons, according to a C-compass, are missing the lowest C♯ and E♭ bells (equating to the second- and fourth-largest bells if they were included). The reason is often financial; by omitting these bells, the construction of a carillon can be reduced significantly, sometimes by 20% for large installations. Since the early 1900s, European installations often reintroduce the E♭ bell, and instead of adding the C♯ bell, they include a B♭ bell (which is a major second below the C-compass bell).\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\nThe carillon originated from two earlier functions of bells: ringing bells to send messages or to indicate the time of day.\\nBellringers attached ropes to the clappers of swinging bells and rang them while stationary in a technique called chiming. Chiming bells gave the ringer more control compared to swinging bells, so was used to send messages to those within earshot. For example, sounding bells was often used to warn of a fire or impending attack. At celebratory events, a bellringer could gather ropes together to chime multiple bells in rhythmic patterns. By the end of the 15th century, chimers are recorded to have used their technique to play music on bells. A 1478 chronicle recounts a man in Dunkirk having made a \"great innovation in honor of God\" by playing melodies on bells. Another one recounts in 1482 a jester from Aalst playing bells in Antwerp with ropes and batons, the latter term suggesting the existence of a keyboard.\\n\\nIn the 14th century, the newly developed escapement technology for mechanical clocks spread throughout European clock towers and gradually replaced the water clock. Since the earliest clocks lacked faces, they announced the time by striking a bell a number of times corresponding to the hour. Eventually, these striking clocks were modified to make a warning signal just before the hour count to draw the attention of listeners to the upcoming announcement. This signal is called the forestrike (Dutch: voorslag). Originally, the forestrike consisted of striking one or two bells, and the systems slowly grew in complexity. By the middle of the 15th century, forestrikes, with three to seven bells, could play simple melodies.\\nAs late as 1510, these two functions were combined into one primitive carillon in the Oudenaarde Town Hall. One set of nine bells was connected to both a keyboard and the clock\\'s forestrike. The Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—were most interested in the potential of using bells to make music. In this region, bellfounding had reached an advanced stage relative to other regions in Europe.\\n\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nThe new instrument developed in the favorable conditions in the Low Countries during the 17th century. Bellfounders found increased financial and technological support as the region traded by sea through ports. Moreover, the political situation under Margaret of Austria and Holy Roman emperor Charles V brought relative wealth and power to cities. Carillons quickly became a fashionable symbol of civic prestige. Cities and towns competed against one another to possess the largest, highest-quality instruments. The demand was met by a successful industry of bellfounding families, notably the Waghevens and Vanden Gheyns. Together, they produced over 50 carillons during the 16th and early 17th centuries. By 1600, the primitive carillon had become an established feature of the region.\\n\\nA critical development for the modern carillon occurred in the 17th century, which involved a partnership between Pieter and François Hemony and Jacob van Eyck. The Hemony brothers were prominent bellfounders known for their precise tuning technique. Van Eyck was a renowned blind carillonneur of Utrecht, who was commissioned by several Dutch cities to maintain and make improvements to their clock chimes and carillons. He was particularly interested in the sounds of bells. In 1633, he developed the ability to isolate and describe a bell\\'s five main overtones and discovered a bell\\'s partial tones can be tuned harmoniously with each other by adjusting the bell\\'s thickness. The Hemony brothers were commissioned in 1644 to cast 19 bells for Zutphen\\'s Wijnhuistoren with Van Eyck as their consultant. By tuning the bells with the advice from Van Eyck, they created the first carillon by the modern definition. According to carillonneur John Gouwens, the quality of the bells was so impressive that Van Eyck recommended casting a full two octaves, or 23 bells. This range has been considered the standard minimum range for carillons ever since. During the next 36 years, the Hemony brothers produced 51 carillons. Carillon culture experienced a peak around this time and until the late-18th century.\\n\\n\\n=== Decline ===\\nThe French Revolution had far-reaching consequences on the Low Countries and the carillon. France conquered and annexed the Austrian Netherlands in 1795 and the United Provinces in 1810. After publishing instructions for extracting copper from bell bronze, France sought to dismantle local carillons to reduce its copper shortage. Carillon owners resisted, for example, by petitioning the new governments to declare their instruments as \"culturally significant\" or by disconnecting the bells and burying them in secret. During this period, as many as 110 carillons existed. About 50 of them were destroyed as a result of war, fire, and dismantling. The majority were melted down to produce cannons for the French Revolutionary Wars.\\nBetween 1750 and the end of the 19th century, interest in the carillon declined greatly. An increasing number of households had access to grandfather clocks and pocket watches, which eroded the carillon\\'s monopoly on announcing the time. As a musical instrument, the carillon lagged behind during the Romantic era, which featured music of a wandering, story-like nature. Many carillons were tuned using meantone temperament, which meant they were not suited for the chromaticism of the newer musical styles. The production of new musical works for the instrument essentially came to a standstill. The standard skill level of carillonneurs had also dropped significantly, so much so that in 1895, the music publisher Schott frères issued Matthias Vanden Gheyn\\'s 11 carillon preludes for piano with a foreword claiming \"no carillonneur of our time knows how to play them on the carillon\". Also, with a reduced demand for new carillons, the tuning techniques developed by the Hemony brothers, but not Van Eyck\\'s underlying theory, were forgotten. Subsequent carillons were generally inferior to earlier installations.\\n\\n\\n=== Revival ===\\nIn the early 1890s, an English change ringer and canon Arthur Simpson published a set of articles on bell tuning, where he argued bell founders had been complacent with their poor tuning methods and proposed solutions to the existing problems. John William Taylor, who had been trying to replicate the tuning techniques of the Hemony brothers and the Vanden Gheyns at his foundry, began working with Simpson. In 1904, they founded the first tuned bells in over a century. The rediscovery initiated a revival of carillon building.\\nIn Mechelen, Belgium, Jef Denyn was a major figure in the carillon\\'s revival as a musical instrument. In 1887, after his father had become completely blind, Denyn took over as the city carillonneur and was responsible for playing the carillon in the tower of St. Rumbold\\'s Cathedral. From the beginning of his career, Denyn advocated for better playability of the instrument. He further developed the tumbler rack system of transmission cables that his father had installed on the cathedral carillon. This allowed the player to have better control over dynamic variations, fast musical passages, and tremolos. Tremolos offered a solution to a Romantic-era limitation of the carillon: its inability to expressively sustain the sound of individual notes.\\n\\nWith his improving skills as a carillonneur and the upgraded cathedral carillon, Denyn\\'s performances began attracting crowds of listeners. He established regular Monday-night concerts at the suggestion of the city council. On 1 August 1892, Denyn hosted the first carillon concert in history. From this point forward, the instrument garnered a reputation as a concert instrument, rather than as an instrument tasked with providing background music.\\n\\n\\n=== Impact of the World Wars ===\\nBecause of his concerts, Denyn met William Gorham Rice, an American state and federal government official from Albany, New York, US. Having traveled to The Hague and been exposed to the carillon, Rice was regularly touring the region to interview carillonneurs for his research. After Denyn\\'s 18 August 1913 evening concert, he and Rice exchanged ideas about the societal and educational value of carillon performances for large audiences. Rice\\'s book Carillons of Belgium and Holland, the first in the English language written specifically about carillons, was published in December 1914 and reprinted three times. The book painted an idealized picture of the region that resonated with the American public, particularly in light of the rape of Belgium. Its success motivated Rice to publish two more books in 1915 and 1925. Rice became an authority on carillons in the United States; besides his books, he gave 35 lectures in several cities, published articles in magazines, spoke on radio programs, and presented exhibition material on the subject between 1912 and 1922. In 1922, Rice garnered financial support from Herbert Hoover and John D. Rockefeller Jr. to establish a carillon school in Mechelen, with Denyn as its first director. It was later named the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\".\\n\\nStephen Thorne of the Canadian military history magazine Legion writes that the Allied Powers of World War I and of World War II saw the destruction of carillons during the respective wars as a \"brutal annihilation of a unique democratic music instrument\". The destruction was highly publicized among the allies of Belgium and the Netherlands. In the latter war, British investigators claimed Germany seized two-thirds of all bells in Belgium and every bell in the Netherlands. Between 1938 and 1945, 175,000 bells were stolen and stored in \"bell cemeteries\" (German: Glockenfriedhöfe). Some 150,000 were sent to foundries and melted down for their copper. Following the war, with the bells out of their towers, E. W. Van Heuven and other physicists could research the tonal qualities of bells in laboratory conditions and with modern electrical sound-analyzing equipment. Percival Price, the Dominion carillonneur at the Peace Tower, was tasked with repatriating as many surviving bells as possible. He also used the opportunity to publish similar research. Every bellfounder could then learn how to cast the highest-quality bells, and the increase in new carillons was greater than ever.\\n\\n\\n=== Movement in North America ===\\nBetween 1922 and 1940, bellfounders installed 43 carillons in the United States and Canada. The flood of carillons onto the continent is attributed to Rice\\'s widely popular books and persistent education in the United States. His romanticized depiction of the cultural instrument prompted wealthy donors to purchase carillons for their own civil and religious communities. Price was appointed to play the carillon at the Metropolitan United Church in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (before working as the Dominion carillonneur); Mary Mesquita Dahlmer was appointed to play at Our Lady of Good Voyage Church in Gloucester, Massachusetts, US. Both were the first professional carillonneurs in their respective countries. In 1936, The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America was founded at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Following the deaths of Denyn in 1941 and Rice in 1945, North American carillonneurs, through their new organization, sought to develop their own authority on education and performance. In the 1950s and 1960s, a distinct North American style of carillon music emerged at the University of Kansas. Ronald Barnes, the university\\'s carillonneur, led in the style and encouraged his peers to compose for the carillon, and produced many of his own compositions.\\n\\n\\n=== International recognition ===\\nIn the 1970s, the idea for a global carillon organization took shape, and the World Carillon Federation was later formed as the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of the pre-existing national or regional carillon associations that had been founded throughout the 20th century.\\nIn 1999, UNESCO designated 32 bell towers in Belgium as a World Heritage Site, in recognition of their architectural diversity and significance. The list was expanded in 2005 to include 23 in France, as well as the tower of Gembloux, Belgium. In 2014, UNESCO recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage, stating that it \"recognizes the creativity of carillonneurs and others who ensure that this cultural form remains relevant to today\\'s local societies.\"\\nIn 2008, the carillon was featured in the film Welcome to the Sticks, a box-office success as the highest-grossing French film ever released in France as of 2021.\\nIn 2019, playing the carillon of St. Coleman\\'s Cathedral in Cobh, Ireland, was recognized by the Irish government as key element of the country\\'s living cultural heritage. In 2025, the casting of bells and playing music on bells was added to Germany\\'s list of intangible cultural heritage.\\n\\n\\n== Usage and repertoire ==\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n\\nThe carillon repertoire skews heavily toward newer works in stark contrast to that of its relative, the organ repertoire. Some 15 collections of carillon music written in the 17th and 18th centuries are known to exist. Like with the pipe organ, early carillon performances consisted mostly of improvisations. In the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, keyboard music was not written for one instrument or another, but rather was written to be played on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the carillon\\'s repertoire in its early history was likely the same as that of the harpsichord, organ, and piano. One of the few surviving examples is the De Gruytters carillon book, dated 1746. The music is arranged,rather than composed, for performance on the carillon and could easily be played on other keyboard instruments. Baroque keyboard music is well suited for carillon transcription, particularly the works of Bach, Corelli, Couperin, Handel, Mozart, and Vivaldi.\\n\\nThe earliest known original compositions specifically for the carillon, and not simply any keyboard, are the 11 preludes of Matthias Vanden Gheyn. The structure of his works suggests he had been playing nonspecific keyboard music on the carillon for many years and that he wanted to play music that is idiomatic to the instrument. Technically challenging, his preludes have been the standard repertoire among carillonneurs since the early 1900s.\\nJef Denyn made many public statements about what music should be performed on the carillon, and he persuaded several composers of the time to write for it. Among those composers were his students, including Staf Nees, Léon Henry, and Jef Rottiers, and composers for other instruments, such as Jef van Hoof. The carillon school began publishing carillon music in 1925. Through his school, Denyn was the early proponent of the \"Mechelen style\" of carillon music, which consists of virtuosic flourishes, tremolos, and other Baroque and Romantic elements.\\nRonald Barnes was the leading figure behind the North American style of carillon music, which developed in the 1950s and 1960s. He encouraged his University of Kansas peers to compose for the carillon, and he produced many of his own compositions. Barnes\\' campaign was most successful with Roy Hamlin Johnson, a piano professor who introduced a whole category of music exclusively native to the carillon featuring the octatonic scale. Many of Johnson\\'s works are acknowledged as masterpieces. Barnes produced 56 original compositions and hundreds of arrangements to expand the available repertoire. Other major 20th-century contributors were Albert Gerken, Gary C. White, Johan Franco, John Pozdro, and Jean W. Miller. The new American style developed into the antithesis of the Mechelen style; instead of exciting, tremolo-filled performances that demonstrate the showmanship of the carillonneur, it features slow passages, sparse harmonies, and impressionist themes to draw the listener\\'s attention to the natural sound of the bells.\\n\\nCarillon music was first published in North America in 1934. G. Schirmer, Inc. published the compositions of Curtis Institute of Music students Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, and Nino Rota as part of the institute\\'s short-lived publishing series. The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America opened the first dedicated publishing house for carillon music in North America in 1961. In 1968, the Anton Brees Carillon Library was established at Bok Tower Gardens in Lake Wales, Florida, US; it contains large collections of carillon music and related materials.\\nIn the late 2010s, University of Michigan professor Tiffany Ng analyzed the diversity of the carillon repertoire. In a bibliography focusing on African-American music and composers, Ng claims, \"while African-American music permeates the carillon repertoire,\" mostly in the form of spirituals, \"almost none of the carillon arrangements and compositions are authored by African Americans.\" In a second bibliography with Emmet Lewis focusing on women, transgender, and non-binary composers, they assert that while many works have been written by these groups, they are often not published through traditional means, and \"gender inequality remains systemic and common practice in carillon concerts.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Performances ===\\n\\nPerformances on the carillon are commonly categorized as either recitals or concerts. Carillon recitals are traditional performances that take place on fixed schedules throughout the week. They may supplement regularly scheduled events, or take place at the convenience of the carillonneur. Traditional since the instrument\\'s inception, this method is the foundation of carillon performance. Concerts refer to special carillon performances, typically featuring a program and a place for the audience to sit and listen. Some carillonneurs may livestream the event so the audience can watch them at the keyboard. The first carillon concert was held on 1 August 1892 as part of Jef Denyn\\'s Monday-evening concert series.\\nThe lack of consistent interest in traditional performances among the general public has caused carillonneurs to engage in musical collaborations and experiments, collectively referred to as \"Carillon Plus\". Carillonneur duos explore the possibility of duet playing and producing new music for the configuration. Others seek to play the carillon in orchestras, bands, and other ensembles. Carillon Plus performances are not new, but have been explored more intensely since the mid-20th century.\\n\\n\\n== Organization and education ==\\nThe World Carillon Federation is the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of pre-existing regional, national, and supranational carillon organizations. As of 2025, it is composed of 15 member organizations:\\n\\nEvery three years, the federation hosts an international congress in a home country of one of the member organizations. The congresses host lectures, workshops, and committee meetings about the topics related to the carillon, for example: news, tutorials and demonstrations, and research developments. Most member organizations give periodic updates to their members on the state of carillon culture in their respective regions.\\n\\nTraining to perform on a carillon can be obtained at several institutions, though the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\" has been the most popular. The LUCA School of Arts in Leuven, Belgium, offers a master\\'s degree in the carillon, and the Utrecht School of the Arts in Amersfoort, Netherlands, has a dedicated school. The Scandinavian Carillon School is located in Denmark, and there are schools in the United Kingdom and France.\\nThe Guild of Carillonneurs in North America organizes carillon examinations during its annual congresses. Those who pass are certified as carillonneur-members of the guild. It also partners with the North American Carillon School, founded in 2012 as an affiliate of the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\". Several American universities offer a carillon program within their curriculum. For example, the University of California, Berkeley; the University of California, Santa Barbara; the University of Denver; the University of Florida; and the University of Michigan offer complete courses of study. Clemson University, Indiana University, Iowa State University, the University of Kansas, and Marquette University offer limited credit for carillon performance. Employed carillonneurs will often offer private lessons at their carillons. Universities that possess a carillon but do not offer course credit often have a student organization or education program, such as the Yale Guild of Carillonneurs, which manages performances on the Yale Memorial Carillon, and the University of Chicago Guild of Carillonists.\\nMusic competitions for carillon are held regularly, with the international Queen Fabiola Competition being the most important.\\n\\n\\n== Distribution ==\\n\\nSeveral institutions register and count carillons worldwide. Some registries specialize in counting specific types of carillons. For example, the War Memorial and Peace Carillons registry counts instruments that serve as war memorials or were built in the name of promoting world peace. TowerBells counts carillons played via a baton keyboard as \"traditional carillons\" and those with computerized or electronic mechanisms as \"non-traditional carillons\", among other bell instruments. It also publishes maps, technical specifications, and summary statistics. As the World Carillon Federation does not consider non-traditional carillons to be carillons, it counts only those which are played via a baton keyboard and without computerized or electronic mechanisms.\\nAccording to TowerBells and the World Carillon Federation,  about 700 traditional carillons exist. At least three can be found on every continent except Antarctica; however, of the countries in which traditional carillons can be found, only six have more than 20. The \"great carillon\" countries—the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United States—account for two-thirds of the world total. Over 90% are in either Western Europe (mainly the Low Countries) or North America. In North America, about 80% of carillons are owned by religious or educational institutions, while in Europe, nearly all carillons are municipally owned. Almost all extant traditional carillons were constructed in the last 100 years; only some 50 historical carillons from the 18th century or earlier still exist. According to TowerBells, there are another 483 non-traditional carillons, which are located mainly in the United States and Western Europe.\\n\\n\\n== Traveling carillons ==\\n\\nTraveling or mobile carillons are those which are not housed in a tower. Instead, the bells and playing console are installed on a frame that allows it to be transported. These carillons have to be much lighter than their non-mobile counterparts. Nora Johnston conceived the idea of a traveling carillon between 1933 and 1938. She connected a traditional baton keyboard to a system of chime bars and fixed the structure to a portable frame. Johnston traveled twice to the United States to perform in radio documentaries, orchestral concerts, and commercials. Subsequent constructions by others used actual carillon bells.\\nAccording to counts by the World Carillon Federation and TowerBells, there are about 20 existing traveling carillons with only three being non-traditional. Many were or are owned by bell foundries as a promotional tool. Almost all traveling carillons are headquartered in Western Europe and the United States. Two American traveling carillons are part of the musical group Cast in Bronze, which features the \"Spirit of the Bells\" playing the carillon in concert with other instruments or a recording. Cast in Bronze is credited with introducing the carillon to the United States\\' public in its mission to promote and preserve the instrument.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nBianzhong, an Eastern instrument having clapperless bells that are struck with hammers\\nCanpanò – Italian bell ringing\\nElectronic carillon\\nFull circle ringing\\nBolognese bell ringing\\nChange ringing\\nVeronese bell ringing\\nRussian Orthodox bell ringing\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nEnglish-speaking carillon organizations\\nWorld Carillon Federation\\nCarillon Society of Britain and Ireland\\nCarillon Society of Australia\\nThe Guild of Carillonneurs in North America\\nNorth American Carillon School\\nShort educational video about the carillon from the World Carillon Federation\\nShort video tutorial on composing for the carillon\\nTutorial website on arranging for the carillon\\nMuseum Klok en Peel (Carillon museum in the Netherlands)', name='get_wikipedia_page', call_id='call_7S0Zd5Q3XiRWDEu7PpB6iaYx', is_error=False)]\n",

      "A carillon (US:  KARR-ə-lon, UK:  kə-RIL-yən) is a pitched percussion instrument that is played with a keyboard and consists of at least 23 bells. The bells are cast in bronze, hung in fixed suspension, and tuned in chromatic order so that they can be sounded harmoniously together. They are struck with clappers connected to a keyboard of wooden batons played with the hands and pedals played with the feet. Often housed in bell towers, carillons are usually owned by churches, universities, or municipalities. They can include an automatic system through which the time is announced and simple tunes are played throughout the day.\n",
      "Carillons come in many designs, weights, sizes, and sounds. They are among the world's heaviest instruments, and the heaviest carillon weighs over 91 metric tons (100 short tons). Most weigh between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons). To be considered a carillon, a minimum of 23 bells is needed; otherwise, it is called a chime. Standard-sized instruments have about 50, and the world's largest has 77 bells. The appearance of  carillons depends on the number and weight of the bells and the tower in which they are housed. They may be found in towers that are free-standing or connected to a building. The bells of a carillon may be directly exposed to the elements or hidden inside the structure of their towers.\n",
      "The origins of the carillon can be traced to the Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—in the 16th century. The modern carillon was invented in 1644 when Jacob van Eyck and the Hemony brothers cast the first tuned carillon. The instrument experienced a peak until the late 18th century, a decline during the French Revolution, a revival in the late 19th century, a second decline during the First and Second World Wars, and a second revival thereafter. UNESCO has designated 56 belfries in Belgium and France as a World Heritage Site and recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage.\n",
      "According to counts by various registries, about 700 carillons exist worldwide. Most are in and around the Low Countries, though nearly 200 have been constructed in North America. Almost all extant carillons were constructed in the 20th century. Additionally, about 500 \"non-traditional\" carillons are known that most registries do not consider to be carillons due to some component of their action being electrified or computerized. A plurality of them is located in the United States, and most of the others are in Western Europe. A few \"traveling\" or \"mobile\" carillons are fixed to a frame that enables them to be transported.\n",

      "== Etymology and terminology ==\n",
      "The word carillon is a loanword from French dating to the late 18th century. It is derived from Old French carignon (an alteration of quarregon) 'a set of four bells'. The word quarregon originates from Latin quaternionem 'set of four'; from quater 'four times'. The word carillon is often stated to have referred originally to a set of four forestrike bells, whose melodies announced the time signal of public hour bells, but this is not confirmed by archival sources. Some convincing evidence shows that the term referred initially to the medieval custom of chiming on sets of four church bells by pulling the clappers by means of ropes. In German, as well as using the French term, a carillon is sometimes called a Glockenspiel (lit. 'bells set'). This should not be confused with the identically named glockenspiel, which itself is sometimes called a carillon in French. Dutch speakers use the word beiaard, which has an uncertain etymology.\n",
      "A musician who plays the carillon is commonly called a carillonneur (US:  KERR-ə-lə-NUR, UK:  kə-RIL-yə-NUR), also lent from French. It and carillon were adopted by English speakers after the introduction of the instrument to British troops following the War of the Spanish Succession in the 18th century. Though the French word carillonneur literally refers to carillon players who are men, the French carillonneuse to denote women is not used in English. Another common term is the English carillonist, which some players of the carillon have wished to replace carillonneur because of the former's gender inclusivity, simple spelling, and unambiguous pronunciation. In 2018, the World Carillon Federation adopted carillonist as the preferred term for its communications.\n",

      "=== Construction ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The carillon is a keyboard instrument. Though it shares similarities with other instruments in this category, such as the organ or pedal piano, its playing console is unique. Playing is done with the player's hands on a manual keyboard composed of rounded, wooden batons. The manual has short chromatic keys (i.e. \"black keys\") raised above the diatonic keys (\"white keys\") and arranged like a piano, but they are spaced far apart, and the chromatic keys are raised above the rest, about 10 cm (4 in). To operate, the keys are depressed with a closed fist. The lowest one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half octaves of the manual are connected to a pedal keyboard played with the feet. The connection is direct, meaning that when a pedal is pressed, its corresponding key on the manual is pulled down with it. Since the mid-20th century, two keyboard design standards have competed for a carillon's console: the North American standard and the North European standard. They differ over several design elements, such as whether the outer pedals curve toward the center or the specific distance a key is depressed. In 2006, the World Carillon Federation developed the WCF Keyboard 2006, which is a compromise between the two standards. The organization recommends that its keyboard standard be used as a guideline when constructing new carillons or renovating existing keyboards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each key is connected to a transmission system by a wire, usually made of stainless steel. When a particular key is depressed, it pulls on the wire, which after interacting with other wires and pulleys, causes a clapper to swing towards the inner wall of the key's corresponding bell. At rest, these clappers are about 2 to 4 cm (0.8 to 1.6 in) away from the bell wall. Small bells are fitted with springs to pull their clappers back immediately after the stroke, so that the bell is not sounded more than once with each keystroke. This is not necessary for large bells, which have sufficiently heavy clappers. Immediately above each key is a wire adjuster called a turnbuckle. These allow the performer to adjust the length of the wire, which often changes with temperature fluctuations.\n",
      "The carillon's cast-bronze, cup-shaped bells are housed at the top of a tower in a structure typically made of steel or wooden beams. The arrangement of the bells depends on the space, height, and construction of the tower, and the number and size of bells. When the heaviest bells are especially large, they are usually placed below the playing cabin to achieve a better tonal distribution. The bells do not move during operation, only the clappers. With some instruments, the heaviest bells may be outfitted with a mechanism enabling them to swing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Mechanization with clock and playing drum ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Carillons may also feature an automatic mechanism by which simple tunes or the Westminster Quarters are played on the lower bells. The mechanism on European carillons is often a playing drum, which is a large metal cylinder connected to a clock mechanism. Metal pegs are screwed onto the outside of the drum. When the clock mechanism sets the drum in motion, the pegs catch onto levers, connected to hammers that rest just a short distance from the outside of the bell. The hammers are briefly raised, and then fall onto the bell as the peg continues to rotate away from the lever. The pegs are arranged such that simple tunes can be programmed to play at specific quarter hours. In North America, automatic-playing drum systems are not common; instead, carillons may have pneumatic systems, which ring the instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Sound ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Carillons produce sound by striking stationary bells, categorizing them as percussion idiophones in the Hornbostel–Sachs classification of musical instruments (111.242.222 – sets of bells with internal strikers). Carillon bells are made of bell bronze, a specialized copper–tin alloy used for its above-average rigidity and resonance. A bell's profile (shape) and weight determine its note and the quality of its tone. Therefore, apart from changes in its profile, such as chipping or corrosion, a bell will never lose its original sound. It produces a sound with overtones, also known as partial tones, which are not necessarily harmonically related. To produce a pleasing, harmonically related series of tones, the bell's profile must be carefully adjusted. Bellfounders typically focus on five principal tones when tuning, most notably the minor third overtone called the tierce, which gives rise to the unique sound of carillons and has been the subject of further research, such as the major third bell. Since the casting process does not reliably produce perfectly tuned bells, they are cast slightly thicker and metal is shaved off with a lathe. On older European carillons, bells were tuned with each other using the meantone temperament tuning system. Modern carillons, particularly those in North America, are tuned to equal temperament.\n",
      "\n",
      "The carillon has a dynamic range similar to a piano, if not more versatile. Through variation of touch, performers can express many volumes. The larger the bell, the larger its dynamic range. Bigger bells will also sound naturally louder than smaller, higher-pitched bells.\n",
      "Along with pipe organs, carillons are among the world's heaviest musical instruments. Most carillons weigh (counting only the weight of the bells) between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons), with extremes ranging from very light 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) instruments to the world's heaviest at over 91 metric tons (100 short tons)—the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon of the Riverside Church in New York City, US. Its bourdon, or largest bell, is the largest tuned bell ever cast for a carillon. It sounds a full octave below most other bourdons. The entire ensemble of fixed and swinging bells, clappers, and steel framework weighs more than 226 metric tons (249 short tons).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Range ===\n",
      "A carillon's range is determined by the number of bells it has, which usually depends on funds available for the creation of the instrument; more money allows more bells to be cast, especially the larger, more costly ones. A carillon, as generally accepted, must have a minimum of 23 bells, or else it is called a chime. No standard pitch range for the carillon has been established, so several subcategories are used to categorize them:\n",
      "\n",
      "Carillons with 23 to 27 bells and 35 to 39 bells are classified as two-octave and three-octave carillons, respectively. Players of these instruments often use music written specifically for the limited ranges.\n",
      "A \"concert\" or \"standard\" carillon typically has 45 to 50 bells, or a range of about four octaves.\n",
      "Carillons with more than 50 bells are often referred to as \"great\" or \"grand\" carillons.\n",
      "Carillons of 15 to 22 bells, which were built before 1940, may be classified as \"historical carillons\" by the World Carillon Federation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The title of \"world's largest carillon by number of bells\" is shared between two instruments: the carillon of the Kirk in the Hills Presbyterian Church in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, US, and the carillon at the Daejeon Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea; both have 77 bells.\n",
      "Since a carillon is seldom played in concert with other instruments, its bourdon may be any pitch—whichever is advantageous for the location and funds available; to simplify the writing and playing of music, keyboards often have a C-compass. As a result, many carillons are transposing instruments, especially those that are small, have many bells, or were constructed on limited funds. The transposition can vary from down a perfect fourth to up an octave. In North America, increasing numbers of new carillons have been installed in concert pitch as a result of the desire to establish the carillon as a full-fledged concert instrument.\n",
      "Many carillons, according to a C-compass, are missing the lowest C♯ and E♭ bells (equating to the second- and fourth-largest bells if they were included). The reason is often financial; by omitting these bells, the construction of a carillon can be reduced significantly, sometimes by 20% for large installations. Since the early 1900s, European installations often reintroduce the E♭ bell, and instead of adding the C♯ bell, they include a B♭ bell (which is a major second below the C-compass bell).\n",

      "== History ==\n",
      "\n",

      "=== Origins ===\n",
      "The carillon originated from two earlier functions of bells: ringing bells to send messages or to indicate the time of day.\n",
      "Bellringers attached ropes to the clappers of swinging bells and rang them while stationary in a technique called chiming. Chiming bells gave the ringer more control compared to swinging bells, so was used to send messages to those within earshot. For example, sounding bells was often used to warn of a fire or impending attack. At celebratory events, a bellringer could gather ropes together to chime multiple bells in rhythmic patterns. By the end of the 15th century, chimers are recorded to have used their technique to play music on bells. A 1478 chronicle recounts a man in Dunkirk having made a \"great innovation in honor of God\" by playing melodies on bells. Another one recounts in 1482 a jester from Aalst playing bells in Antwerp with ropes and batons, the latter term suggesting the existence of a keyboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 14th century, the newly developed escapement technology for mechanical clocks spread throughout European clock towers and gradually replaced the water clock. Since the earliest clocks lacked faces, they announced the time by striking a bell a number of times corresponding to the hour. Eventually, these striking clocks were modified to make a warning signal just before the hour count to draw the attention of listeners to the upcoming announcement. This signal is called the forestrike (Dutch: voorslag). Originally, the forestrike consisted of striking one or two bells, and the systems slowly grew in complexity. By the middle of the 15th century, forestrikes, with three to seven bells, could play simple melodies.\n",
      "As late as 1510, these two functions were combined into one primitive carillon in the Oudenaarde Town Hall. One set of nine bells was connected to both a keyboard and the clock's forestrike. The Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—were most interested in the potential of using bells to make music. In this region, bellfounding had reached an advanced stage relative to other regions in Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Development ===\n",
      "The new instrument developed in the favorable conditions in the Low Countries during the 17th century. Bellfounders found increased financial and technological support as the region traded by sea through ports. Moreover, the political situation under Margaret of Austria and Holy Roman emperor Charles V brought relative wealth and power to cities. Carillons quickly became a fashionable symbol of civic prestige. Cities and towns competed against one another to possess the largest, highest-quality instruments. The demand was met by a successful industry of bellfounding families, notably the Waghevens and Vanden Gheyns. Together, they produced over 50 carillons during the 16th and early 17th centuries. By 1600, the primitive carillon had become an established feature of the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "A critical development for the modern carillon occurred in the 17th century, which involved a partnership between Pieter and François Hemony and Jacob van Eyck. The Hemony brothers were prominent bellfounders known for their precise tuning technique. Van Eyck was a renowned blind carillonneur of Utrecht, who was commissioned by several Dutch cities to maintain and make improvements to their clock chimes and carillons. He was particularly interested in the sounds of bells. In 1633, he developed the ability to isolate and describe a bell's five main overtones and discovered a bell's partial tones can be tuned harmoniously with each other by adjusting the bell's thickness. The Hemony brothers were commissioned in 1644 to cast 19 bells for Zutphen's Wijnhuistoren with Van Eyck as their consultant. By tuning the bells with the advice from Van Eyck, they created the first carillon by the modern definition. According to carillonneur John Gouwens, the quality of the bells was so impressive that Van Eyck recommended casting a full two octaves, or 23 bells. This range has been considered the standard minimum range for carillons ever since. During the next 36 years, the Hemony brothers produced 51 carillons. Carillon culture experienced a peak around this time and until the late-18th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Decline ===\n",
      "The French Revolution had far-reaching consequences on the Low Countries and the carillon. France conquered and annexed the Austrian Netherlands in 1795 and the United Provinces in 1810. After publishing instructions for extracting copper from bell bronze, France sought to dismantle local carillons to reduce its copper shortage. Carillon owners resisted, for example, by petitioning the new governments to declare their instruments as \"culturally significant\" or by disconnecting the bells and burying them in secret. During this period, as many as 110 carillons existed. About 50 of them were destroyed as a result of war, fire, and dismantling. The majority were melted down to produce cannons for the French Revolutionary Wars.\n",
      "Between 1750 and the end of the 19th century, interest in the carillon declined greatly. An increasing number of households had access to grandfather clocks and pocket watches, which eroded the carillon's monopoly on announcing the time. As a musical instrument, the carillon lagged behind during the Romantic era, which featured music of a wandering, story-like nature. Many carillons were tuned using meantone temperament, which meant they were not suited for the chromaticism of the newer musical styles. The production of new musical works for the instrument essentially came to a standstill. The standard skill level of carillonneurs had also dropped significantly, so much so that in 1895, the music publisher Schott frères issued Matthias Vanden Gheyn's 11 carillon preludes for piano with a foreword claiming \"no carillonneur of our time knows how to play them on the carillon\". Also, with a reduced demand for new carillons, the tuning techniques developed by the Hemony brothers, but not Van Eyck's underlying theory, were forgotten. Subsequent carillons were generally inferior to earlier installations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Revival ===\n",
      "In the early 1890s, an English change ringer and canon Arthur Simpson published a set of articles on bell tuning, where he argued bell founders had been complacent with their poor tuning methods and proposed solutions to the existing problems. John William Taylor, who had been trying to replicate the tuning techniques of the Hemony brothers and the Vanden Gheyns at his foundry, began working with Simpson. In 1904, they founded the first tuned bells in over a century. The rediscovery initiated a revival of carillon building.\n",
      "In Mechelen, Belgium, Jef Denyn was a major figure in the carillon's revival as a musical instrument. In 1887, after his father had become completely blind, Denyn took over as the city carillonneur and was responsible for playing the carillon in the tower of St. Rumbold's Cathedral. From the beginning of his career, Denyn advocated for better playability of the instrument. He further developed the tumbler rack system of transmission cables that his father had installed on the cathedral carillon. This allowed the player to have better control over dynamic variations, fast musical passages, and tremolos. Tremolos offered a solution to a Romantic-era limitation of the carillon: its inability to expressively sustain the sound of individual notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "With his improving skills as a carillonneur and the upgraded cathedral carillon, Denyn's performances began attracting crowds of listeners. He established regular Monday-night concerts at the suggestion of the city council. On 1 August 1892, Denyn hosted the first carillon concert in history. From this point forward, the instrument garnered a reputation as a concert instrument, rather than as an instrument tasked with providing background music.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Impact of the World Wars ===\n",
      "Because of his concerts, Denyn met William Gorham Rice, an American state and federal government official from Albany, New York, US. Having traveled to The Hague and been exposed to the carillon, Rice was regularly touring the region to interview carillonneurs for his research. After Denyn's 18 August 1913 evening concert, he and Rice exchanged ideas about the societal and educational value of carillon performances for large audiences. Rice's book Carillons of Belgium and Holland, the first in the English language written specifically about carillons, was published in December 1914 and reprinted three times. The book painted an idealized picture of the region that resonated with the American public, particularly in light of the rape of Belgium. Its success motivated Rice to publish two more books in 1915 and 1925. Rice became an authority on carillons in the United States; besides his books, he gave 35 lectures in several cities, published articles in magazines, spoke on radio programs, and presented exhibition material on the subject between 1912 and 1922. In 1922, Rice garnered financial support from Herbert Hoover and John D. Rockefeller Jr. to establish a carillon school in Mechelen, with Denyn as its first director. It was later named the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Stephen Thorne of the Canadian military history magazine Legion writes that the Allied Powers of World War I and of World War II saw the destruction of carillons during the respective wars as a \"brutal annihilation of a unique democratic music instrument\". The destruction was highly publicized among the allies of Belgium and the Netherlands. In the latter war, British investigators claimed Germany seized two-thirds of all bells in Belgium and every bell in the Netherlands. Between 1938 and 1945, 175,000 bells were stolen and stored in \"bell cemeteries\" (German: Glockenfriedhöfe). Some 150,000 were sent to foundries and melted down for their copper. Following the war, with the bells out of their towers, E. W. Van Heuven and other physicists could research the tonal qualities of bells in laboratory conditions and with modern electrical sound-analyzing equipment. Percival Price, the Dominion carillonneur at the Peace Tower, was tasked with repatriating as many surviving bells as possible. He also used the opportunity to publish similar research. Every bellfounder could then learn how to cast the highest-quality bells, and the increase in new carillons was greater than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Movement in North America ===\n",
      "Between 1922 and 1940, bellfounders installed 43 carillons in the United States and Canada. The flood of carillons onto the continent is attributed to Rice's widely popular books and persistent education in the United States. His romanticized depiction of the cultural instrument prompted wealthy donors to purchase carillons for their own civil and religious communities. Price was appointed to play the carillon at the Metropolitan United Church in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (before working as the Dominion carillonneur); Mary Mesquita Dahlmer was appointed to play at Our Lady of Good Voyage Church in Gloucester, Massachusetts, US. Both were the first professional carillonneurs in their respective countries. In 1936, The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America was founded at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Following the deaths of Denyn in 1941 and Rice in 1945, North American carillonneurs, through their new organization, sought to develop their own authority on education and performance. In the 1950s and 1960s, a distinct North American style of carillon music emerged at the University of Kansas. Ronald Barnes, the university's carillonneur, led in the style and encouraged his peers to compose for the carillon, and produced many of his own compositions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== International recognition ===\n",
      "In the 1970s, the idea for a global carillon organization took shape, and the World Carillon Federation was later formed as the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of the pre-existing national or regional carillon associations that had been founded throughout the 20th century.\n",
      "In 1999, UNESCO designated 32 bell towers in Belgium as a World Heritage Site, in recognition of their architectural diversity and significance. The list was expanded in 2005 to include 23 in France, as well as the tower of Gembloux, Belgium. In 2014, UNESCO recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage, stating that it \"recognizes the creativity of carillonneurs and others who ensure that this cultural form remains relevant to today's local societies.\"\n",
      "In 2008, the carillon was featured in the film Welcome to the Sticks, a box-office success as the highest-grossing French film ever released in France as of 2021.\n",
      "In 2019, playing the carillon of St. Coleman's Cathedral in Cobh, Ireland, was recognized by the Irish government as key element of the country's living cultural heritage. In 2025, the casting of bells and playing music on bells was added to Germany's list of intangible cultural heritage.\n",

      "== Usage and repertoire ==\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Music ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The carillon repertoire skews heavily toward newer works in stark contrast to that of its relative, the organ repertoire. Some 15 collections of carillon music written in the 17th and 18th centuries are known to exist. Like with the pipe organ, early carillon performances consisted mostly of improvisations. In the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, keyboard music was not written for one instrument or another, but rather was written to be played on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the carillon's repertoire in its early history was likely the same as that of the harpsichord, organ, and piano. One of the few surviving examples is the De Gruytters carillon book, dated 1746. The music is arranged,rather than composed, for performance on the carillon and could easily be played on other keyboard instruments. Baroque keyboard music is well suited for carillon transcription, particularly the works of Bach, Corelli, Couperin, Handel, Mozart, and Vivaldi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The earliest known original compositions specifically for the carillon, and not simply any keyboard, are the 11 preludes of Matthias Vanden Gheyn. The structure of his works suggests he had been playing nonspecific keyboard music on the carillon for many years and that he wanted to play music that is idiomatic to the instrument. Technically challenging, his preludes have been the standard repertoire among carillonneurs since the early 1900s.\n",
      "Jef Denyn made many public statements about what music should be performed on the carillon, and he persuaded several composers of the time to write for it. Among those composers were his students, including Staf Nees, Léon Henry, and Jef Rottiers, and composers for other instruments, such as Jef van Hoof. The carillon school began publishing carillon music in 1925. Through his school, Denyn was the early proponent of the \"Mechelen style\" of carillon music, which consists of virtuosic flourishes, tremolos, and other Baroque and Romantic elements.\n",
      "Ronald Barnes was the leading figure behind the North American style of carillon music, which developed in the 1950s and 1960s. He encouraged his University of Kansas peers to compose for the carillon, and he produced many of his own compositions. Barnes' campaign was most successful with Roy Hamlin Johnson, a piano professor who introduced a whole category of music exclusively native to the carillon featuring the octatonic scale. Many of Johnson's works are acknowledged as masterpieces. Barnes produced 56 original compositions and hundreds of arrangements to expand the available repertoire. Other major 20th-century contributors were Albert Gerken, Gary C. White, Johan Franco, John Pozdro, and Jean W. Miller. The new American style developed into the antithesis of the Mechelen style; instead of exciting, tremolo-filled performances that demonstrate the showmanship of the carillonneur, it features slow passages, sparse harmonies, and impressionist themes to draw the listener's attention to the natural sound of the bells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carillon music was first published in North America in 1934. G. Schirmer, Inc. published the compositions of Curtis Institute of Music students Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, and Nino Rota as part of the institute's short-lived publishing series. The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America opened the first dedicated publishing house for carillon music in North America in 1961. In 1968, the Anton Brees Carillon Library was established at Bok Tower Gardens in Lake Wales, Florida, US; it contains large collections of carillon music and related materials.\n",
      "In the late 2010s, University of Michigan professor Tiffany Ng analyzed the diversity of the carillon repertoire. In a bibliography focusing on African-American music and composers, Ng claims, \"while African-American music permeates the carillon repertoire,\" mostly in the form of spirituals, \"almost none of the carillon arrangements and compositions are authored by African Americans.\" In a second bibliography with Emmet Lewis focusing on women, transgender, and non-binary composers, they assert that while many works have been written by these groups, they are often not published through traditional means, and \"gender inequality remains systemic and common practice in carillon concerts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Performances ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Performances on the carillon are commonly categorized as either recitals or concerts. Carillon recitals are traditional performances that take place on fixed schedules throughout the week. They may supplement regularly scheduled events, or take place at the convenience of the carillonneur. Traditional since the instrument's inception, this method is the foundation of carillon performance. Concerts refer to special carillon performances, typically featuring a program and a place for the audience to sit and listen. Some carillonneurs may livestream the event so the audience can watch them at the keyboard. The first carillon concert was held on 1 August 1892 as part of Jef Denyn's Monday-evening concert series.\n",
      "The lack of consistent interest in traditional performances among the general public has caused carillonneurs to engage in musical collaborations and experiments, collectively referred to as \"Carillon Plus\". Carillonneur duos explore the possibility of duet playing and producing new music for the configuration. Others seek to play the carillon in orchestras, bands, and other ensembles. Carillon Plus performances are not new, but have been explored more intensely since the mid-20th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Organization and education ==\n",
      "The World Carillon Federation is the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of pre-existing regional, national, and supranational carillon organizations. As of 2025, it is composed of 15 member organizations:\n",
      "\n",
      "Every three years, the federation hosts an international congress in a home country of one of the member organizations. The congresses host lectures, workshops, and committee meetings about the topics related to the carillon, for example: news, tutorials and demonstrations, and research developments. Most member organizations give periodic updates to their members on the state of carillon culture in their respective regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Training to perform on a carillon can be obtained at several institutions, though the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\" has been the most popular. The LUCA School of Arts in Leuven, Belgium, offers a master's degree in the carillon, and the Utrecht School of the Arts in Amersfoort, Netherlands, has a dedicated school. The Scandinavian Carillon School is located in Denmark, and there are schools in the United Kingdom and France.\n",
      "The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America organizes carillon examinations during its annual congresses. Those who pass are certified as carillonneur-members of the guild. It also partners with the North American Carillon School, founded in 2012 as an affiliate of the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\". Several American universities offer a carillon program within their curriculum. For example, the University of California, Berkeley; the University of California, Santa Barbara; the University of Denver; the University of Florida; and the University of Michigan offer complete courses of study. Clemson University, Indiana University, Iowa State University, the University of Kansas, and Marquette University offer limited credit for carillon performance. Employed carillonneurs will often offer private lessons at their carillons. Universities that possess a carillon but do not offer course credit often have a student organization or education program, such as the Yale Guild of Carillonneurs, which manages performances on the Yale Memorial Carillon, and the University of Chicago Guild of Carillonists.\n",
      "Music competitions for carillon are held regularly, with the international Queen Fabiola Competition being the most important.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Distribution ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Several institutions register and count carillons worldwide. Some registries specialize in counting specific types of carillons. For example, the War Memorial and Peace Carillons registry counts instruments that serve as war memorials or were built in the name of promoting world peace. TowerBells counts carillons played via a baton keyboard as \"traditional carillons\" and those with computerized or electronic mechanisms as \"non-traditional carillons\", among other bell instruments. It also publishes maps, technical specifications, and summary statistics. As the World Carillon Federation does not consider non-traditional carillons to be carillons, it counts only those which are played via a baton keyboard and without computerized or electronic mechanisms.\n",
      "According to TowerBells and the World Carillon Federation,  about 700 traditional carillons exist. At least three can be found on every continent except Antarctica; however, of the countries in which traditional carillons can be found, only six have more than 20. The \"great carillon\" countries—the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United States—account for two-thirds of the world total. Over 90% are in either Western Europe (mainly the Low Countries) or North America. In North America, about 80% of carillons are owned by religious or educational institutions, while in Europe, nearly all carillons are municipally owned. Almost all extant traditional carillons were constructed in the last 100 years; only some 50 historical carillons from the 18th century or earlier still exist. According to TowerBells, there are another 483 non-traditional carillons, which are located mainly in the United States and Western Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Traveling carillons ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Traveling or mobile carillons are those which are not housed in a tower. Instead, the bells and playing console are installed on a frame that allows it to be transported. These carillons have to be much lighter than their non-mobile counterparts. Nora Johnston conceived the idea of a traveling carillon between 1933 and 1938. She connected a traditional baton keyboard to a system of chime bars and fixed the structure to a portable frame. Johnston traveled twice to the United States to perform in radio documentaries, orchestral concerts, and commercials. Subsequent constructions by others used actual carillon bells.\n",
      "According to counts by the World Carillon Federation and TowerBells, there are about 20 existing traveling carillons with only three being non-traditional. Many were or are owned by bell foundries as a promotional tool. Almost all traveling carillons are headquartered in Western Europe and the United States. Two American traveling carillons are part of the musical group Cast in Bronze, which features the \"Spirit of the Bells\" playing the carillon in concert with other instruments or a recording. Cast in Bronze is credited with introducing the carillon to the United States' public in its mission to promote and preserve the instrument.\n",

The bells are cast in bronze, hung in fixed suspension, and tuned in chromatic order so that they can be sounded harmoniously together. They are struck with clappers connected to a keyboard of wooden batons played with the hands and pedals played with the feet. Often housed in bell towers, carillons are usually owned by churches, universities, or municipalities. They can include an automatic system through which the time is announced and simple tunes are played throughout the day.\\nCarillons come in many designs, weights, sizes, and sounds. They are among the world\\'s heaviest instruments, and the heaviest carillon weighs over 91 metric tons (100 short tons). Most weigh between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons). To be considered a carillon, a minimum of 23 bells is needed; otherwise, it is called a chime. Standard-sized instruments have about 50, and the world\\'s largest has 77 bells. The appearance of  carillons depends on the number and weight of the bells and the tower in which they are housed. They may be found in towers that are free-standing or connected to a building. The bells of a carillon may be directly exposed to the elements or hidden inside the structure of their towers.\\nThe origins of the carillon can be traced to the Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—in the 16th century. The modern carillon was invented in 1644 when Jacob van Eyck and the Hemony brothers cast the first tuned carillon. The instrument experienced a peak until the late 18th century, a decline during the French Revolution, a revival in the late 19th century, a second decline during the First and Second World Wars, and a second revival thereafter. UNESCO has designated 56 belfries in Belgium and France as a World Heritage Site and recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage.\\nAccording to counts by various registries, about 700 carillons exist worldwide. Most are in and around the Low Countries, though nearly 200 have been constructed in North America. Almost all extant carillons were constructed in the 20th century. Additionally, about 500 \"non-traditional\" carillons are known that most registries do not consider to be carillons due to some component of their action being electrified or computerized. A plurality of them is located in the United States, and most of the others are in Western Europe. A few \"traveling\" or \"mobile\" carillons are fixed to a frame that enables them to be transported.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology and terminology ==\\nThe word carillon is a loanword from French dating to the late 18th century. It is derived from Old French carignon (an alteration of quarregon) \\'a set of four bells\\'. The word quarregon originates from Latin quaternionem \\'set of four\\'; from quater \\'four times\\'. The word carillon is often stated to have referred originally to a set of four forestrike bells, whose melodies announced the time signal of public hour bells, but this is not confirmed by archival sources. Some convincing evidence shows that the term referred initially to the medieval custom of chiming on sets of four church bells by pulling the clappers by means of ropes. In German, as well as using the French term, a carillon is sometimes called a Glockenspiel (lit.\\u2009\\'bells set\\'). This should not be confused with the identically named glockenspiel, which itself is sometimes called a carillon in French. Dutch speakers use the word beiaard, which has an uncertain etymology.\\nA musician who plays the carillon is commonly called a carillonneur (US:  KERR-ə-lə-NUR, UK:  kə-RIL-yə-NUR), also lent from French. It and carillon were adopted by English speakers after the introduction of the instrument to British troops following the War of the Spanish Succession in the 18th century. Though the French word carillonneur literally refers to carillon players who are men, the French carillonneuse to denote women is not used in English. Another common term is the English carillonist, which some players of the carillon have wished to replace carillonneur because of the former\\'s gender inclusivity, simple spelling, and unambiguous pronunciation. In 2018, the World Carillon Federation adopted carillonist as the preferred term for its communications.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Construction ===\\n\\nThe carillon is a keyboard instrument. Though it shares similarities with other instruments in this category, such as the organ or pedal piano, its playing console is unique. Playing is done with the player\\'s hands on a manual keyboard composed of rounded, wooden batons. The manual has short chromatic keys (i.e. \"black keys\") raised above the diatonic keys (\"white keys\") and arranged like a piano, but they are spaced far apart, and the chromatic keys are raised above the rest, about 10 cm (4 in). To operate, the keys are depressed with a closed fist. The lowest one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half octaves of the manual are connected to a pedal keyboard played with the feet. The connection is direct, meaning that when a pedal is pressed, its corresponding key on the manual is pulled down with it. Since the mid-20th century, two keyboard design standards have competed for a carillon\\'s console: the North American standard and the North European standard. They differ over several design elements, such as whether the outer pedals curve toward the center or the specific distance a key is depressed. In 2006, the World Carillon Federation developed the WCF Keyboard 2006, which is a compromise between the two standards. The organization recommends that its keyboard standard be used as a guideline when constructing new carillons or renovating existing keyboards.\\n\\nEach key is connected to a transmission system by a wire, usually made of stainless steel. When a particular key is depressed, it pulls on the wire, which after interacting with other wires and pulleys, causes a clapper to swing towards the inner wall of the key\\'s corresponding bell. At rest, these clappers are about 2 to 4 cm (0.8 to 1.6 in) away from the bell wall. Small bells are fitted with springs to pull their clappers back immediately after the stroke, so that the bell is not sounded more than once with each keystroke. This is not necessary for large bells, which have sufficiently heavy clappers. Immediately above each key is a wire adjuster called a turnbuckle. These allow the performer to adjust the length of the wire, which often changes with temperature fluctuations.\\nThe carillon\\'s cast-bronze, cup-shaped bells are housed at the top of a tower in a structure typically made of steel or wooden beams. The arrangement of the bells depends on the space, height, and construction of the tower, and the number and size of bells. When the heaviest bells are especially large, they are usually placed below the playing cabin to achieve a better tonal distribution. The bells do not move during operation, only the clappers. With some instruments, the heaviest bells may be outfitted with a mechanism enabling them to swing.\\n\\n\\n=== Mechanization with clock and playing drum ===\\n\\nCarillons may also feature an automatic mechanism by which simple tunes or the Westminster Quarters are played on the lower bells. The mechanism on European carillons is often a playing drum, which is a large metal cylinder connected to a clock mechanism. Metal pegs are screwed onto the outside of the drum. When the clock mechanism sets the drum in motion, the pegs catch onto levers, connected to hammers that rest just a short distance from the outside of the bell. The hammers are briefly raised, and then fall onto the bell as the peg continues to rotate away from the lever. The pegs are arranged such that simple tunes can be programmed to play at specific quarter hours. In North America, automatic-playing drum systems are not common; instead, carillons may have pneumatic systems, which ring the instrument.\\n\\n\\n=== Sound ===\\n\\nCarillons produce sound by striking stationary bells, categorizing them as percussion idiophones in the Hornbostel–Sachs classification of musical instruments (111.242.222 – sets of bells with internal strikers). Carillon bells are made of bell bronze, a specialized copper–tin alloy used for its above-average rigidity and resonance. A bell\\'s profile (shape) and weight determine its note and the quality of its tone. Therefore, apart from changes in its profile, such as chipping or corrosion, a bell will never lose its original sound. It produces a sound with overtones, also known as partial tones, which are not necessarily harmonically related. To produce a pleasing, harmonically related series of tones, the bell\\'s profile must be carefully adjusted. Bellfounders typically focus on five principal tones when tuning, most notably the minor third overtone called the tierce, which gives rise to the unique sound of carillons and has been the subject of further research, such as the major third bell. Since the casting process does not reliably produce perfectly tuned bells, they are cast slightly thicker and metal is shaved off with a lathe. On older European carillons, bells were tuned with each other using the meantone temperament tuning system. Modern carillons, particularly those in North America, are tuned to equal temperament.\\n\\nThe carillon has a dynamic range similar to a piano, if not more versatile. Through variation of touch, performers can express many volumes. The larger the bell, the larger its dynamic range. Bigger bells will also sound naturally louder than smaller, higher-pitched bells.\\nAlong with pipe organs, carillons are among the world\\'s heaviest musical instruments. Most carillons weigh (counting only the weight of the bells) between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons), with extremes ranging from very light 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) instruments to the world\\'s heaviest at over 91 metric tons (100 short tons)—the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon of the Riverside Church in New York City, US. Its bourdon, or largest bell, is the largest tuned bell ever cast for a carillon. It sounds a full octave below most other bourdons. The entire ensemble of fixed and swinging bells, clappers, and steel framework weighs more than 226 metric tons (249 short tons).\\n\\n\\n=== Range ===\\nA carillon\\'s range is determined by the number of bells it has, which usually depends on funds available for the creation of the instrument; more money allows more bells to be cast, especially the larger, more costly ones. A carillon, as generally accepted, must have a minimum of 23 bells, or else it is called a chime. No standard pitch range for the carillon has been established, so several subcategories are used to categorize them:\\n\\nCarillons with 23 to 27 bells and 35 to 39 bells are classified as two-octave and three-octave carillons, respectively. Players of these instruments often use music written specifically for the limited ranges.\\nA \"concert\" or \"standard\" carillon typically has 45 to 50 bells, or a range of about four octaves.\\nCarillons with more than 50 bells are often referred to as \"great\" or \"grand\" carillons.\\nCarillons of 15 to 22 bells, which were built before 1940, may be classified as \"historical carillons\" by the World Carillon Federation.\\n\\nThe title of \"world\\'s largest carillon by number of bells\" is shared between two instruments: the carillon of the Kirk in the Hills Presbyterian Church in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, US, and the carillon at the Daejeon Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea; both have 77 bells.\\nSince a carillon is seldom played in concert with other instruments, its bourdon may be any pitch—whichever is advantageous for the location and funds available; to simplify the writing and playing of music, keyboards often have a C-compass. As a result, many carillons are transposing instruments, especially those that are small, have many bells, or were constructed on limited funds. The transposition can vary from down a perfect fourth to up an octave. In North America, increasing numbers of new carillons have been installed in concert pitch as a result of the desire to establish the carillon as a full-fledged concert instrument.\\nMany carillons, according to a C-compass, are missing the lowest C♯ and E♭ bells (equating to the second- and fourth-largest bells if they were included). The reason is often financial; by omitting these bells, the construction of a carillon can be reduced significantly, sometimes by 20% for large installations. Since the early 1900s, European installations often reintroduce the E♭ bell, and instead of adding the C♯ bell, they include a B♭ bell (which is a major second below the C-compass bell).\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\nThe carillon originated from two earlier functions of bells: ringing bells to send messages or to indicate the time of day.\\nBellringers attached ropes to the clappers of swinging bells and rang them while stationary in a technique called chiming. Chiming bells gave the ringer more control compared to swinging bells, so was used to send messages to those within earshot. For example, sounding bells was often used to warn of a fire or impending attack. At celebratory events, a bellringer could gather ropes together to chime multiple bells in rhythmic patterns. By the end of the 15th century, chimers are recorded to have used their technique to play music on bells. A 1478 chronicle recounts a man in Dunkirk having made a \"great innovation in honor of God\" by playing melodies on bells. Another one recounts in 1482 a jester from Aalst playing bells in Antwerp with ropes and batons, the latter term suggesting the existence of a keyboard.\\n\\nIn the 14th century, the newly developed escapement technology for mechanical clocks spread throughout European clock towers and gradually replaced the water clock. Since the earliest clocks lacked faces, they announced the time by striking a bell a number of times corresponding to the hour. Eventually, these striking clocks were modified to make a warning signal just before the hour count to draw the attention of listeners to the upcoming announcement. This signal is called the forestrike (Dutch: voorslag). Originally, the forestrike consisted of striking one or two bells, and the systems slowly grew in complexity. By the middle of the 15th century, forestrikes, with three to seven bells, could play simple melodies.\\nAs late as 1510, these two functions were combined into one primitive carillon in the Oudenaarde Town Hall. One set of nine bells was connected to both a keyboard and the clock\\'s forestrike. The Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—were most interested in the potential of using bells to make music. In this region, bellfounding had reached an advanced stage relative to other regions in Europe.\\n\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nThe new instrument developed in the favorable conditions in the Low Countries during the 17th century. Bellfounders found increased financial and technological support as the region traded by sea through ports. Moreover, the political situation under Margaret of Austria and Holy Roman emperor Charles V brought relative wealth and power to cities. Carillons quickly became a fashionable symbol of civic prestige. Cities and towns competed against one another to possess the largest, highest-quality instruments. The demand was met by a successful industry of bellfounding families, notably the Waghevens and Vanden Gheyns. Together, they produced over 50 carillons during the 16th and early 17th centuries. By 1600, the primitive carillon had become an established feature of the region.\\n\\nA critical development for the modern carillon occurred in the 17th century, which involved a partnership between Pieter and François Hemony and Jacob van Eyck. The Hemony brothers were prominent bellfounders known for their precise tuning technique. Van Eyck was a renowned blind carillonneur of Utrecht, who was commissioned by several Dutch cities to maintain and make improvements to their clock chimes and carillons. He was particularly interested in the sounds of bells. In 1633, he developed the ability to isolate and describe a bell\\'s five main overtones and discovered a bell\\'s partial tones can be tuned harmoniously with each other by adjusting the bell\\'s thickness. The Hemony brothers were commissioned in 1644 to cast 19 bells for Zutphen\\'s Wijnhuistoren with Van Eyck as their consultant. By tuning the bells with the advice from Van Eyck, they created the first carillon by the modern definition. According to carillonneur John Gouwens, the quality of the bells was so impressive that Van Eyck recommended casting a full two octaves, or 23 bells. This range has been considered the standard minimum range for carillons ever since. During the next 36 years, the Hemony brothers produced 51 carillons. Carillon culture experienced a peak around this time and until the late-18th century.\\n\\n\\n=== Decline ===\\nThe French Revolution had far-reaching consequences on the Low Countries and the carillon. France conquered and annexed the Austrian Netherlands in 1795 and the United Provinces in 1810. After publishing instructions for extracting copper from bell bronze, France sought to dismantle local carillons to reduce its copper shortage. Carillon owners resisted, for example, by petitioning the new governments to declare their instruments as \"culturally significant\" or by disconnecting the bells and burying them in secret. During this period, as many as 110 carillons existed. About 50 of them were destroyed as a result of war, fire, and dismantling. The majority were melted down to produce cannons for the French Revolutionary Wars.\\nBetween 1750 and the end of the 19th century, interest in the carillon declined greatly. An increasing number of households had access to grandfather clocks and pocket watches, which eroded the carillon\\'s monopoly on announcing the time. As a musical instrument, the carillon lagged behind during the Romantic era, which featured music of a wandering, story-like nature. Many carillons were tuned using meantone temperament, which meant they were not suited for the chromaticism of the newer musical styles. The production of new musical works for the instrument essentially came to a standstill. The standard skill level of carillonneurs had also dropped significantly, so much so that in 1895, the music publisher Schott frères issued Matthias Vanden Gheyn\\'s 11 carillon preludes for piano with a foreword claiming \"no carillonneur of our time knows how to play them on the carillon\". Also, with a reduced demand for new carillons, the tuning techniques developed by the Hemony brothers, but not Van Eyck\\'s underlying theory, were forgotten. Subsequent carillons were generally inferior to earlier installations.\\n\\n\\n=== Revival ===\\nIn the early 1890s, an English change ringer and canon Arthur Simpson published a set of articles on bell tuning, where he argued bell founders had been complacent with their poor tuning methods and proposed solutions to the existing problems. John William Taylor, who had been trying to replicate the tuning techniques of the Hemony brothers and the Vanden Gheyns at his foundry, began working with Simpson. In 1904, they founded the first tuned bells in over a century. The rediscovery initiated a revival of carillon building.\\nIn Mechelen, Belgium, Jef Denyn was a major figure in the carillon\\'s revival as a musical instrument. In 1887, after his father had become completely blind, Denyn took over as the city carillonneur and was responsible for playing the carillon in the tower of St. Rumbold\\'s Cathedral. From the beginning of his career, Denyn advocated for better playability of the instrument. He further developed the tumbler rack system of transmission cables that his father had installed on the cathedral carillon. This allowed the player to have better control over dynamic variations, fast musical passages, and tremolos. Tremolos offered a solution to a Romantic-era limitation of the carillon: its inability to expressively sustain the sound of individual notes.\\n\\nWith his improving skills as a carillonneur and the upgraded cathedral carillon, Denyn\\'s performances began attracting crowds of listeners. He established regular Monday-night concerts at the suggestion of the city council. On 1 August 1892, Denyn hosted the first carillon concert in history. From this point forward, the instrument garnered a reputation as a concert instrument, rather than as an instrument tasked with providing background music.\\n\\n\\n=== Impact of the World Wars ===\\nBecause of his concerts, Denyn met William Gorham Rice, an American state and federal government official from Albany, New York, US. Having traveled to The Hague and been exposed to the carillon, Rice was regularly touring the region to interview carillonneurs for his research. After Denyn\\'s 18 August 1913 evening concert, he and Rice exchanged ideas about the societal and educational value of carillon performances for large audiences. Rice\\'s book Carillons of Belgium and Holland, the first in the English language written specifically about carillons, was published in December 1914 and reprinted three times. The book painted an idealized picture of the region that resonated with the American public, particularly in light of the rape of Belgium. Its success motivated Rice to publish two more books in 1915 and 1925. Rice became an authority on carillons in the United States; besides his books, he gave 35 lectures in several cities, published articles in magazines, spoke on radio programs, and presented exhibition material on the subject between 1912 and 1922. In 1922, Rice garnered financial support from Herbert Hoover and John D. Rockefeller Jr. to establish a carillon school in Mechelen, with Denyn as its first director. It was later named the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\".\\n\\nStephen Thorne of the Canadian military history magazine Legion writes that the Allied Powers of World War I and of World War II saw the destruction of carillons during the respective wars as a \"brutal annihilation of a unique democratic music instrument\". The destruction was highly publicized among the allies of Belgium and the Netherlands. In the latter war, British investigators claimed Germany seized two-thirds of all bells in Belgium and every bell in the Netherlands. Between 1938 and 1945, 175,000 bells were stolen and stored in \"bell cemeteries\" (German: Glockenfriedhöfe). Some 150,000 were sent to foundries and melted down for their copper. Following the war, with the bells out of their towers, E. W. Van Heuven and other physicists could research the tonal qualities of bells in laboratory conditions and with modern electrical sound-analyzing equipment. Percival Price, the Dominion carillonneur at the Peace Tower, was tasked with repatriating as many surviving bells as possible. He also used the opportunity to publish similar research. Every bellfounder could then learn how to cast the highest-quality bells, and the increase in new carillons was greater than ever.\\n\\n\\n=== Movement in North America ===\\nBetween 1922 and 1940, bellfounders installed 43 carillons in the United States and Canada. The flood of carillons onto the continent is attributed to Rice\\'s widely popular books and persistent education in the United States. His romanticized depiction of the cultural instrument prompted wealthy donors to purchase carillons for their own civil and religious communities. Price was appointed to play the carillon at the Metropolitan United Church in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (before working as the Dominion carillonneur); Mary Mesquita Dahlmer was appointed to play at Our Lady of Good Voyage Church in Gloucester, Massachusetts, US. Both were the first professional carillonneurs in their respective countries. In 1936, The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America was founded at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Following the deaths of Denyn in 1941 and Rice in 1945, North American carillonneurs, through their new organization, sought to develop their own authority on education and performance. In the 1950s and 1960s, a distinct North American style of carillon music emerged at the University of Kansas. Ronald Barnes, the university\\'s carillonneur, led in the style and encouraged his peers to compose for the carillon, and produced many of his own compositions.\\n\\n\\n=== International recognition ===\\nIn the 1970s, the idea for a global carillon organization took shape, and the World Carillon Federation was later formed as the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of the pre-existing national or regional carillon associations that had been founded throughout the 20th century.\\nIn 1999, UNESCO designated 32 bell towers in Belgium as a World Heritage Site, in recognition of their architectural diversity and significance. The list was expanded in 2005 to include 23 in France, as well as the tower of Gembloux, Belgium. In 2014, UNESCO recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage, stating that it \"recognizes the creativity of carillonneurs and others who ensure that this cultural form remains relevant to today\\'s local societies.\"\\nIn 2008, the carillon was featured in the film Welcome to the Sticks, a box-office success as the highest-grossing French film ever released in France as of 2021.\\nIn 2019, playing the carillon of St. Coleman\\'s Cathedral in Cobh, Ireland, was recognized by the Irish government as key element of the country\\'s living cultural heritage. In 2025, the casting of bells and playing music on bells was added to Germany\\'s list of intangible cultural heritage.\\n\\n\\n== Usage and repertoire ==\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n\\nThe carillon repertoire skews heavily toward newer works in stark contrast to that of its relative, the organ repertoire. Some 15 collections of carillon music written in the 17th and 18th centuries are known to exist. Like with the pipe organ, early carillon performances consisted mostly of improvisations. In the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, keyboard music was not written for one instrument or another, but rather was written to be played on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the carillon\\'s repertoire in its early history was likely the same as that of the harpsichord, organ, and piano. One of the few surviving examples is the De Gruytters carillon book, dated 1746. The music is arranged,rather than composed, for performance on the carillon and could easily be played on other keyboard instruments. Baroque keyboard music is well suited for carillon transcription, particularly the works of Bach, Corelli, Couperin, Handel, Mozart, and Vivaldi.\\n\\nThe earliest known original compositions specifically for the carillon, and not simply any keyboard, are the 11 preludes of Matthias Vanden Gheyn. The structure of his works suggests he had been playing nonspecific keyboard music on the carillon for many years and that he wanted to play music that is idiomatic to the instrument. Technically challenging, his preludes have been the standard repertoire among carillonneurs since the early 1900s.\\nJef Denyn made many public statements about what music should be performed on the carillon, and he persuaded several composers of the time to write for it. Among those composers were his students, including Staf Nees, Léon Henry, and Jef Rottiers, and composers for other instruments, such as Jef van Hoof. The carillon school began publishing carillon music in 1925. Through his school, Denyn was the early proponent of the \"Mechelen style\" of carillon music, which consists of virtuosic flourishes, tremolos, and other Baroque and Romantic elements.\\nRonald Barnes was the leading figure behind the North American style of carillon music, which developed in the 1950s and 1960s. He encouraged his University of Kansas peers to compose for the carillon, and he produced many of his own compositions. Barnes\\' campaign was most successful with Roy Hamlin Johnson, a piano professor who introduced a whole category of music exclusively native to the carillon featuring the octatonic scale. Many of Johnson\\'s works are acknowledged as masterpieces. Barnes produced 56 original compositions and hundreds of arrangements to expand the available repertoire. Other major 20th-century contributors were Albert Gerken, Gary C. White, Johan Franco, John Pozdro, and Jean W. Miller. The new American style developed into the antithesis of the Mechelen style; instead of exciting, tremolo-filled performances that demonstrate the showmanship of the carillonneur, it features slow passages, sparse harmonies, and impressionist themes to draw the listener\\'s attention to the natural sound of the bells.\\n\\nCarillon music was first published in North America in 1934. G. Schirmer, Inc. published the compositions of Curtis Institute of Music students Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, and Nino Rota as part of the institute\\'s short-lived publishing series. The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America opened the first dedicated publishing house for carillon music in North America in 1961. In 1968, the Anton Brees Carillon Library was established at Bok Tower Gardens in Lake Wales, Florida, US; it contains large collections of carillon music and related materials.\\nIn the late 2010s, University of Michigan professor Tiffany Ng analyzed the diversity of the carillon repertoire. In a bibliography focusing on African-American music and composers, Ng claims, \"while African-American music permeates the carillon repertoire,\" mostly in the form of spirituals, \"almost none of the carillon arrangements and compositions are authored by African Americans.\" In a second bibliography with Emmet Lewis focusing on women, transgender, and non-binary composers, they assert that while many works have been written by these groups, they are often not published through traditional means, and \"gender inequality remains systemic and common practice in carillon concerts.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Performances ===\\n\\nPerformances on the carillon are commonly categorized as either recitals or concerts. Carillon recitals are traditional performances that take place on fixed schedules throughout the week. They may supplement regularly scheduled events, or take place at the convenience of the carillonneur. Traditional since the instrument\\'s inception, this method is the foundation of carillon performance. Concerts refer to special carillon performances, typically featuring a program and a place for the audience to sit and listen. Some carillonneurs may livestream the event so the audience can watch them at the keyboard. The first carillon concert was held on 1 August 1892 as part of Jef Denyn\\'s Monday-evening concert series.\\nThe lack of consistent interest in traditional performances among the general public has caused carillonneurs to engage in musical collaborations and experiments, collectively referred to as \"Carillon Plus\". Carillonneur duos explore the possibility of duet playing and producing new music for the configuration. Others seek to play the carillon in orchestras, bands, and other ensembles. Carillon Plus performances are not new, but have been explored more intensely since the mid-20th century.\\n\\n\\n== Organization and education ==\\nThe World Carillon Federation is the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of pre-existing regional, national, and supranational carillon organizations. As of 2025, it is composed of 15 member organizations:\\n\\nEvery three years, the federation hosts an international congress in a home country of one of the member organizations. The congresses host lectures, workshops, and committee meetings about the topics related to the carillon, for example: news, tutorials and demonstrations, and research developments. Most member organizations give periodic updates to their members on the state of carillon culture in their respective regions.\\n\\nTraining to perform on a carillon can be obtained at several institutions, though the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\" has been the most popular. The LUCA School of Arts in Leuven, Belgium, offers a master\\'s degree in the carillon, and the Utrecht School of the Arts in Amersfoort, Netherlands, has a dedicated school. The Scandinavian Carillon School is located in Denmark, and there are schools in the United Kingdom and France.\\nThe Guild of Carillonneurs in North America organizes carillon examinations during its annual congresses. Those who pass are certified as carillonneur-members of the guild. It also partners with the North American Carillon School, founded in 2012 as an affiliate of the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\". Several American universities offer a carillon program within their curriculum. For example, the University of California, Berkeley; the University of California, Santa Barbara; the University of Denver; the University of Florida; and the University of Michigan offer complete courses of study. Clemson University, Indiana University, Iowa State University, the University of Kansas, and Marquette University offer limited credit for carillon performance. Employed carillonneurs will often offer private lessons at their carillons. Universities that possess a carillon but do not offer course credit often have a student organization or education program, such as the Yale Guild of Carillonneurs, which manages performances on the Yale Memorial Carillon, and the University of Chicago Guild of Carillonists.\\nMusic competitions for carillon are held regularly, with the international Queen Fabiola Competition being the most important.\\n\\n\\n== Distribution ==\\n\\nSeveral institutions register and count carillons worldwide. Some registries specialize in counting specific types of carillons. For example, the War Memorial and Peace Carillons registry counts instruments that serve as war memorials or were built in the name of promoting world peace. TowerBells counts carillons played via a baton keyboard as \"traditional carillons\" and those with computerized or electronic mechanisms as \"non-traditional carillons\", among other bell instruments. It also publishes maps, technical specifications, and summary statistics. As the World Carillon Federation does not consider non-traditional carillons to be carillons, it counts only those which are played via a baton keyboard and without computerized or electronic mechanisms.\\nAccording to TowerBells and the World Carillon Federation,  about 700 traditional carillons exist. At least three can be found on every continent except Antarctica; however, of the countries in which traditional carillons can be found, only six have more than 20. The \"great carillon\" countries—the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United States—account for two-thirds of the world total. Over 90% are in either Western Europe (mainly the Low Countries) or North America. In North America, about 80% of carillons are owned by religious or educational institutions, while in Europe, nearly all carillons are municipally owned. Almost all extant traditional carillons were constructed in the last 100 years; only some 50 historical carillons from the 18th century or earlier still exist. According to TowerBells, there are another 483 non-traditional carillons, which are located mainly in the United States and Western Europe.\\n\\n\\n== Traveling carillons ==\\n\\nTraveling or mobile carillons are those which are not housed in a tower. Instead, the bells and playing console are installed on a frame that allows it to be transported. These carillons have to be much lighter than their non-mobile counterparts. Nora Johnston conceived the idea of a traveling carillon between 1933 and 1938. She connected a traditional baton keyboard to a system of chime bars and fixed the structure to a portable frame. Johnston traveled twice to the United States to perform in radio documentaries, orchestral concerts, and commercials. Subsequent constructions by others used actual carillon bells.\\nAccording to counts by the World Carillon Federation and TowerBells, there are about 20 existing traveling carillons with only three being non-traditional. Many were or are owned by bell foundries as a promotional tool. Almost all traveling carillons are headquartered in Western Europe and the United States. Two American traveling carillons are part of the musical group Cast in Bronze, which features the \"Spirit of the Bells\" playing the carillon in concert with other instruments or a recording. Cast in Bronze is credited with introducing the carillon to the United States\\' public in its mission to promote and preserve the instrument.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nBianzhong, an Eastern instrument having clapperless bells that are struck with hammers\\nCanpanò – Italian bell ringing\\nElectronic carillon\\nFull circle ringing\\nBolognese bell ringing\\nChange ringing\\nVeronese bell ringing\\nRussian Orthodox bell ringing\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nEnglish-speaking carillon organizations\\nWorld Carillon Federation\\nCarillon Society of Britain and Ireland\\nCarillon Society of Australia\\nThe Guild of Carillonneurs in North America\\nNorth American Carillon School\\nShort educational video about the carillon from the World Carillon Federation\\nShort video tutorial on composing for the carillon\\nTutorial website on arranging for the carillon\\nMuseum Klok en Peel (Carillon museum in the Netherlands)', name='get_wikipedia_page', call_id='call_7S0Zd5Q3XiRWDEu7PpB6iaYx', is_error=False)], type='ToolCallExecutionEvent'), ToolCallSummaryMessage(id='9b627e9a-1a19-45a3-911e-6ad5c36abb0b', source='timeline_creator', models_usage=None, metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 23, 16, 0, 16, 802129, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='A carillon (US:  KARR-ə-lon, UK:  kə-RIL-yən) is a pitched percussion instrument that is played with a keyboard and consists of at least 23 bells. The bells are cast in bronze, hung in fixed suspension, and tuned in chromatic order so that they can be sounded harmoniously together. They are struck with clappers connected to a keyboard of wooden batons played with the hands and pedals played with the feet. Often housed in bell towers, carillons are usually owned by churches, universities, or municipalities. They can include an automatic system through which the time is announced and simple tunes are played throughout the day.\\nCarillons come in many designs, weights, sizes, and sounds. They are among the world\\'s heaviest instruments, and the heaviest carillon weighs over 91 metric tons (100 short tons). Most weigh between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons). To be considered a carillon, a minimum of 23 bells is needed; otherwise, it is called a chime. Standard-sized instruments have about 50, and the world\\'s largest has 77 bells. The appearance of  carillons depends on the number and weight of the bells and the tower in which they are housed. They may be found in towers that are free-standing or connected to a building. The bells of a carillon may be directly exposed to the elements or hidden inside the structure of their towers.\\nThe origins of the carillon can be traced to the Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—in the 16th century. The modern carillon was invented in 1644 when Jacob van Eyck and the Hemony brothers cast the first tuned carillon. The instrument experienced a peak until the late 18th century, a decline during the French Revolution, a revival in the late 19th century, a second decline during the First and Second World Wars, and a second revival thereafter. UNESCO has designated 56 belfries in Belgium and France as a World Heritage Site and recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage.\\nAccording to counts by various registries, about 700 carillons exist worldwide. Most are in and around the Low Countries, though nearly 200 have been constructed in North America. Almost all extant carillons were constructed in the 20th century. Additionally, about 500 \"non-traditional\" carillons are known that most registries do not consider to be carillons due to some component of their action being electrified or computerized. A plurality of them is located in the United States, and most of the others are in Western Europe. A few \"traveling\" or \"mobile\" carillons are fixed to a frame that enables them to be transported.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology and terminology ==\\nThe word carillon is a loanword from French dating to the late 18th century. It is derived from Old French carignon (an alteration of quarregon) \\'a set of four bells\\'. The word quarregon originates from Latin quaternionem \\'set of four\\'; from quater \\'four times\\'. The word carillon is often stated to have referred originally to a set of four forestrike bells, whose melodies announced the time signal of public hour bells, but this is not confirmed by archival sources. Some convincing evidence shows that the term referred initially to the medieval custom of chiming on sets of four church bells by pulling the clappers by means of ropes. In German, as well as using the French term, a carillon is sometimes called a Glockenspiel (lit.\\u2009\\'bells set\\'). This should not be confused with the identically named glockenspiel, which itself is sometimes called a carillon in French. Dutch speakers use the word beiaard, which has an uncertain etymology.\\nA musician who plays the carillon is commonly called a carillonneur (US:  KERR-ə-lə-NUR, UK:  kə-RIL-yə-NUR), also lent from French. It and carillon were adopted by English speakers after the introduction of the instrument to British troops following the War of the Spanish Succession in the 18th century. Though the French word carillonneur literally refers to carillon players who are men, the French carillonneuse to denote women is not used in English. Another common term is the English carillonist, which some players of the carillon have wished to replace carillonneur because of the former\\'s gender inclusivity, simple spelling, and unambiguous pronunciation. In 2018, the World Carillon Federation adopted carillonist as the preferred term for its communications.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Construction ===\\n\\nThe carillon is a keyboard instrument. Though it shares similarities with other instruments in this category, such as the organ or pedal piano, its playing console is unique. Playing is done with the player\\'s hands on a manual keyboard composed of rounded, wooden batons. The manual has short chromatic keys (i.e. \"black keys\") raised above the diatonic keys (\"white keys\") and arranged like a piano, but they are spaced far apart, and the chromatic keys are raised above the rest, about 10 cm (4 in). To operate, the keys are depressed with a closed fist. The lowest one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half octaves of the manual are connected to a pedal keyboard played with the feet. The connection is direct, meaning that when a pedal is pressed, its corresponding key on the manual is pulled down with it. Since the mid-20th century, two keyboard design standards have competed for a carillon\\'s console: the North American standard and the North European standard. They differ over several design elements, such as whether the outer pedals curve toward the center or the specific distance a key is depressed. In 2006, the World Carillon Federation developed the WCF Keyboard 2006, which is a compromise between the two standards. The organization recommends that its keyboard standard be used as a guideline when constructing new carillons or renovating existing keyboards.\\n\\nEach key is connected to a transmission system by a wire, usually made of stainless steel. When a particular key is depressed, it pulls on the wire, which after interacting with other wires and pulleys, causes a clapper to swing towards the inner wall of the key\\'s corresponding bell. At rest, these clappers are about 2 to 4 cm (0.8 to 1.6 in) away from the bell wall. Small bells are fitted with springs to pull their clappers back immediately after the stroke, so that the bell is not sounded more than once with each keystroke. This is not necessary for large bells, which have sufficiently heavy clappers. Immediately above each key is a wire adjuster called a turnbuckle. These allow the performer to adjust the length of the wire, which often changes with temperature fluctuations.\\nThe carillon\\'s cast-bronze, cup-shaped bells are housed at the top of a tower in a structure typically made of steel or wooden beams. The arrangement of the bells depends on the space, height, and construction of the tower, and the number and size of bells. When the heaviest bells are especially large, they are usually placed below the playing cabin to achieve a better tonal distribution. The bells do not move during operation, only the clappers. With some instruments, the heaviest bells may be outfitted with a mechanism enabling them to swing.\\n\\n\\n=== Mechanization with clock and playing drum ===\\n\\nCarillons may also feature an automatic mechanism by which simple tunes or the Westminster Quarters are played on the lower bells. The mechanism on European carillons is often a playing drum, which is a large metal cylinder connected to a clock mechanism. Metal pegs are screwed onto the outside of the drum. When the clock mechanism sets the drum in motion, the pegs catch onto levers, connected to hammers that rest just a short distance from the outside of the bell. The hammers are briefly raised, and then fall onto the bell as the peg continues to rotate away from the lever. The pegs are arranged such that simple tunes can be programmed to play at specific quarter hours. In North America, automatic-playing drum systems are not common; instead, carillons may have pneumatic systems, which ring the instrument.\\n\\n\\n=== Sound ===\\n\\nCarillons produce sound by striking stationary bells, categorizing them as percussion idiophones in the Hornbostel–Sachs classification of musical instruments (111.242.222 – sets of bells with internal strikers). Carillon bells are made of bell bronze, a specialized copper–tin alloy used for its above-average rigidity and resonance. A bell\\'s profile (shape) and weight determine its note and the quality of its tone. Therefore, apart from changes in its profile, such as chipping or corrosion, a bell will never lose its original sound. It produces a sound with overtones, also known as partial tones, which are not necessarily harmonically related. To produce a pleasing, harmonically related series of tones, the bell\\'s profile must be carefully adjusted. Bellfounders typically focus on five principal tones when tuning, most notably the minor third overtone called the tierce, which gives rise to the unique sound of carillons and has been the subject of further research, such as the major third bell. Since the casting process does not reliably produce perfectly tuned bells, they are cast slightly thicker and metal is shaved off with a lathe. On older European carillons, bells were tuned with each other using the meantone temperament tuning system. Modern carillons, particularly those in North America, are tuned to equal temperament.\\n\\nThe carillon has a dynamic range similar to a piano, if not more versatile. Through variation of touch, performers can express many volumes. The larger the bell, the larger its dynamic range. Bigger bells will also sound naturally louder than smaller, higher-pitched bells.\\nAlong with pipe organs, carillons are among the world\\'s heaviest musical instruments. Most carillons weigh (counting only the weight of the bells) between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons), with extremes ranging from very light 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) instruments to the world\\'s heaviest at over 91 metric tons (100 short tons)—the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon of the Riverside Church in New York City, US. Its bourdon, or largest bell, is the largest tuned bell ever cast for a carillon. It sounds a full octave below most other bourdons. The entire ensemble of fixed and swinging bells, clappers, and steel framework weighs more than 226 metric tons (249 short tons).\\n\\n\\n=== Range ===\\nA carillon\\'s range is determined by the number of bells it has, which usually depends on funds available for the creation of the instrument; more money allows more bells to be cast, especially the larger, more costly ones. A carillon, as generally accepted, must have a minimum of 23 bells, or else it is called a chime. No standard pitch range for the carillon has been established, so several subcategories are used to categorize them:\\n\\nCarillons with 23 to 27 bells and 35 to 39 bells are classified as two-octave and three-octave carillons, respectively. Players of these instruments often use music written specifically for the limited ranges.\\nA \"concert\" or \"standard\" carillon typically has 45 to 50 bells, or a range of about four octaves.\\nCarillons with more than 50 bells are often referred to as \"great\" or \"grand\" carillons.\\nCarillons of 15 to 22 bells, which were built before 1940, may be classified as \"historical carillons\" by the World Carillon Federation.\\n\\nThe title of \"world\\'s largest carillon by number of bells\" is shared between two instruments: the carillon of the Kirk in the Hills Presbyterian Church in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, US, and the carillon at the Daejeon Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea; both have 77 bells.\\nSince a carillon is seldom played in concert with other instruments, its bourdon may be any pitch—whichever is advantageous for the location and funds available; to simplify the writing and playing of music, keyboards often have a C-compass. As a result, many carillons are transposing instruments, especially those that are small, have many bells, or were constructed on limited funds. The transposition can vary from down a perfect fourth to up an octave. In North America, increasing numbers of new carillons have been installed in concert pitch as a result of the desire to establish the carillon as a full-fledged concert instrument.\\nMany carillons, according to a C-compass, are missing the lowest C♯ and E♭ bells (equating to the second- and fourth-largest bells if they were included). The reason is often financial; by omitting these bells, the construction of a carillon can be reduced significantly, sometimes by 20% for large installations. Since the early 1900s, European installations often reintroduce the E♭ bell, and instead of adding the C♯ bell, they include a B♭ bell (which is a major second below the C-compass bell).\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\nThe carillon originated from two earlier functions of bells: ringing bells to send messages or to indicate the time of day.\\nBellringers attached ropes to the clappers of swinging bells and rang them while stationary in a technique called chiming. Chiming bells gave the ringer more control compared to swinging bells, so was used to send messages to those within earshot. For example, sounding bells was often used to warn of a fire or impending attack. At celebratory events, a bellringer could gather ropes together to chime multiple bells in rhythmic patterns. By the end of the 15th century, chimers are recorded to have used their technique to play music on bells. A 1478 chronicle recounts a man in Dunkirk having made a \"great innovation in honor of God\" by playing melodies on bells. Another one recounts in 1482 a jester from Aalst playing bells in Antwerp with ropes and batons, the latter term suggesting the existence of a keyboard.\\n\\nIn the 14th century, the newly developed escapement technology for mechanical clocks spread throughout European clock towers and gradually replaced the water clock. Since the earliest clocks lacked faces, they announced the time by striking a bell a number of times corresponding to the hour. Eventually, these striking clocks were modified to make a warning signal just before the hour count to draw the attention of listeners to the upcoming announcement. This signal is called the forestrike (Dutch: voorslag). Originally, the forestrike consisted of striking one or two bells, and the systems slowly grew in complexity. By the middle of the 15th century, forestrikes, with three to seven bells, could play simple melodies.\\nAs late as 1510, these two functions were combined into one primitive carillon in the Oudenaarde Town Hall. One set of nine bells was connected to both a keyboard and the clock\\'s forestrike. The Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—were most interested in the potential of using bells to make music. In this region, bellfounding had reached an advanced stage relative to other regions in Europe.\\n\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nThe new instrument developed in the favorable conditions in the Low Countries during the 17th century. Bellfounders found increased financial and technological support as the region traded by sea through ports. Moreover, the political situation under Margaret of Austria and Holy Roman emperor Charles V brought relative wealth and power to cities. Carillons quickly became a fashionable symbol of civic prestige. Cities and towns competed against one another to possess the largest, highest-quality instruments. The demand was met by a successful industry of bellfounding families, notably the Waghevens and Vanden Gheyns. Together, they produced over 50 carillons during the 16th and early 17th centuries. By 1600, the primitive carillon had become an established feature of the region.\\n\\nA critical development for the modern carillon occurred in the 17th century, which involved a partnership between Pieter and François Hemony and Jacob van Eyck. The Hemony brothers were prominent bellfounders known for their precise tuning technique. Van Eyck was a renowned blind carillonneur of Utrecht, who was commissioned by several Dutch cities to maintain and make improvements to their clock chimes and carillons. He was particularly interested in the sounds of bells. In 1633, he developed the ability to isolate and describe a bell\\'s five main overtones and discovered a bell\\'s partial tones can be tuned harmoniously with each other by adjusting the bell\\'s thickness. The Hemony brothers were commissioned in 1644 to cast 19 bells for Zutphen\\'s Wijnhuistoren with Van Eyck as their consultant. By tuning the bells with the advice from Van Eyck, they created the first carillon by the modern definition. According to carillonneur John Gouwens, the quality of the bells was so impressive that Van Eyck recommended casting a full two octaves, or 23 bells. This range has been considered the standard minimum range for carillons ever since. During the next 36 years, the Hemony brothers produced 51 carillons. Carillon culture experienced a peak around this time and until the late-18th century.\\n\\n\\n=== Decline ===\\nThe French Revolution had far-reaching consequences on the Low Countries and the carillon. France conquered and annexed the Austrian Netherlands in 1795 and the United Provinces in 1810. After publishing instructions for extracting copper from bell bronze, France sought to dismantle local carillons to reduce its copper shortage. Carillon owners resisted, for example, by petitioning the new governments to declare their instruments as \"culturally significant\" or by disconnecting the bells and burying them in secret. During this period, as many as 110 carillons existed. About 50 of them were destroyed as a result of war, fire, and dismantling. The majority were melted down to produce cannons for the French Revolutionary Wars.\\nBetween 1750 and the end of the 19th century, interest in the carillon declined greatly. An increasing number of households had access to grandfather clocks and pocket watches, which eroded the carillon\\'s monopoly on announcing the time. As a musical instrument, the carillon lagged behind during the Romantic era, which featured music of a wandering, story-like nature. Many carillons were tuned using meantone temperament, which meant they were not suited for the chromaticism of the newer musical styles. The production of new musical works for the instrument essentially came to a standstill. The standard skill level of carillonneurs had also dropped significantly, so much so that in 1895, the music publisher Schott frères issued Matthias Vanden Gheyn\\'s 11 carillon preludes for piano with a foreword claiming \"no carillonneur of our time knows how to play them on the carillon\". Also, with a reduced demand for new carillons, the tuning techniques developed by the Hemony brothers, but not Van Eyck\\'s underlying theory, were forgotten. Subsequent carillons were generally inferior to earlier installations.\\n\\n\\n=== Revival ===\\nIn the early 1890s, an English change ringer and canon Arthur Simpson published a set of articles on bell tuning, where he argued bell founders had been complacent with their poor tuning methods and proposed solutions to the existing problems. John William Taylor, who had been trying to replicate the tuning techniques of the Hemony brothers and the Vanden Gheyns at his foundry, began working with Simpson. In 1904, they founded the first tuned bells in over a century. The rediscovery initiated a revival of carillon building.\\nIn Mechelen, Belgium, Jef Denyn was a major figure in the carillon\\'s revival as a musical instrument. In 1887, after his father had become completely blind, Denyn took over as the city carillonneur and was responsible for playing the carillon in the tower of St. Rumbold\\'s Cathedral. From the beginning of his career, Denyn advocated for better playability of the instrument. He further developed the tumbler rack system of transmission cables that his father had installed on the cathedral carillon. This allowed the player to have better control over dynamic variations, fast musical passages, and tremolos. Tremolos offered a solution to a Romantic-era limitation of the carillon: its inability to expressively sustain the sound of individual notes.\\n\\nWith his improving skills as a carillonneur and the upgraded cathedral carillon, Denyn\\'s performances began attracting crowds of listeners. He established regular Monday-night concerts at the suggestion of the city council. On 1 August 1892, Denyn hosted the first carillon concert in history. From this point forward, the instrument garnered a reputation as a concert instrument, rather than as an instrument tasked with providing background music.\\n\\n\\n=== Impact of the World Wars ===\\nBecause of his concerts, Denyn met William Gorham Rice, an American state and federal government official from Albany, New York, US. Having traveled to The Hague and been exposed to the carillon, Rice was regularly touring the region to interview carillonneurs for his research. After Denyn\\'s 18 August 1913 evening concert, he and Rice exchanged ideas about the societal and educational value of carillon performances for large audiences. Rice\\'s book Carillons of Belgium and Holland, the first in the English language written specifically about carillons, was published in December 1914 and reprinted three times. The book painted an idealized picture of the region that resonated with the American public, particularly in light of the rape of Belgium. Its success motivated Rice to publish two more books in 1915 and 1925. Rice became an authority on carillons in the United States; besides his books, he gave 35 lectures in several cities, published articles in magazines, spoke on radio programs, and presented exhibition material on the subject between 1912 and 1922. In 1922, Rice garnered financial support from Herbert Hoover and John D. Rockefeller Jr. to establish a carillon school in Mechelen, with Denyn as its first director. It was later named the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\".\\n\\nStephen Thorne of the Canadian military history magazine Legion writes that the Allied Powers of World War I and of World War II saw the destruction of carillons during the respective wars as a \"brutal annihilation of a unique democratic music instrument\". The destruction was highly publicized among the allies of Belgium and the Netherlands. In the latter war, British investigators claimed Germany seized two-thirds of all bells in Belgium and every bell in the Netherlands. Between 1938 and 1945, 175,000 bells were stolen and stored in \"bell cemeteries\" (German: Glockenfriedhöfe). Some 150,000 were sent to foundries and melted down for their copper. Following the war, with the bells out of their towers, E. W. Van Heuven and other physicists could research the tonal qualities of bells in laboratory conditions and with modern electrical sound-analyzing equipment. Percival Price, the Dominion carillonneur at the Peace Tower, was tasked with repatriating as many surviving bells as possible. He also used the opportunity to publish similar research. Every bellfounder could then learn how to cast the highest-quality bells, and the increase in new carillons was greater than ever.\\n\\n\\n=== Movement in North America ===\\nBetween 1922 and 1940, bellfounders installed 43 carillons in the United States and Canada. The flood of carillons onto the continent is attributed to Rice\\'s widely popular books and persistent education in the United States. His romanticized depiction of the cultural instrument prompted wealthy donors to purchase carillons for their own civil and religious communities. Price was appointed to play the carillon at the Metropolitan United Church in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (before working as the Dominion carillonneur); Mary Mesquita Dahlmer was appointed to play at Our Lady of Good Voyage Church in Gloucester, Massachusetts, US. Both were the first professional carillonneurs in their respective countries. In 1936, The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America was founded at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Following the deaths of Denyn in 1941 and Rice in 1945, North American carillonneurs, through their new organization, sought to develop their own authority on education and performance. In the 1950s and 1960s, a distinct North American style of carillon music emerged at the University of Kansas. Ronald Barnes, the university\\'s carillonneur, led in the style and encouraged his peers to compose for the carillon, and produced many of his own compositions.\\n\\n\\n=== International recognition ===\\nIn the 1970s, the idea for a global carillon organization took shape, and the World Carillon Federation was later formed as the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of the pre-existing national or regional carillon associations that had been founded throughout the 20th century.\\nIn 1999, UNESCO designated 32 bell towers in Belgium as a World Heritage Site, in recognition of their architectural diversity and significance. The list was expanded in 2005 to include 23 in France, as well as the tower of Gembloux, Belgium. In 2014, UNESCO recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage, stating that it \"recognizes the creativity of carillonneurs and others who ensure that this cultural form remains relevant to today\\'s local societies.\"\\nIn 2008, the carillon was featured in the film Welcome to the Sticks, a box-office success as the highest-grossing French film ever released in France as of 2021.\\nIn 2019, playing the carillon of St. Coleman\\'s Cathedral in Cobh, Ireland, was recognized by the Irish government as key element of the country\\'s living cultural heritage. In 2025, the casting of bells and playing music on bells was added to Germany\\'s list of intangible cultural heritage.\\n\\n\\n== Usage and repertoire ==\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n\\nThe carillon repertoire skews heavily toward newer works in stark contrast to that of its relative, the organ repertoire. Some 15 collections of carillon music written in the 17th and 18th centuries are known to exist. Like with the pipe organ, early carillon performances consisted mostly of improvisations. In the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, keyboard music was not written for one instrument or another, but rather was written to be played on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the carillon\\'s repertoire in its early history was likely the same as that of the harpsichord, organ, and piano. One of the few surviving examples is the De Gruytters carillon book, dated 1746. The music is arranged,rather than composed, for performance on the carillon and could easily be played on other keyboard instruments. Baroque keyboard music is well suited for carillon transcription, particularly the works of Bach, Corelli, Couperin, Handel, Mozart, and Vivaldi.\\n\\nThe earliest known original compositions specifically for the carillon, and not simply any keyboard, are the 11 preludes of Matthias Vanden Gheyn. The structure of his works suggests he had been playing nonspecific keyboard music on the carillon for many years and that he wanted to play music that is idiomatic to the instrument. Technically challenging, his preludes have been the standard repertoire among carillonneurs since the early 1900s.\\nJef Denyn made many public statements about what music should be performed on the carillon, and he persuaded several composers of the time to write for it. Among those composers were his students, including Staf Nees, Léon Henry, and Jef Rottiers, and composers for other instruments, such as Jef van Hoof. The carillon school began publishing carillon music in 1925. Through his school, Denyn was the early proponent of the \"Mechelen style\" of carillon music, which consists of virtuosic flourishes, tremolos, and other Baroque and Romantic elements.\\nRonald Barnes was the leading figure behind the North American style of carillon music, which developed in the 1950s and 1960s. He encouraged his University of Kansas peers to compose for the carillon, and he produced many of his own compositions. Barnes\\' campaign was most successful with Roy Hamlin Johnson, a piano professor who introduced a whole category of music exclusively native to the carillon featuring the octatonic scale. Many of Johnson\\'s works are acknowledged as masterpieces. Barnes produced 56 original compositions and hundreds of arrangements to expand the available repertoire. Other major 20th-century contributors were Albert Gerken, Gary C. White, Johan Franco, John Pozdro, and Jean W. Miller. The new American style developed into the antithesis of the Mechelen style; instead of exciting, tremolo-filled performances that demonstrate the showmanship of the carillonneur, it features slow passages, sparse harmonies, and impressionist themes to draw the listener\\'s attention to the natural sound of the bells.\\n\\nCarillon music was first published in North America in 1934. G. Schirmer, Inc. published the compositions of Curtis Institute of Music students Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, and Nino Rota as part of the institute\\'s short-lived publishing series. The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America opened the first dedicated publishing house for carillon music in North America in 1961. In 1968, the Anton Brees Carillon Library was established at Bok Tower Gardens in Lake Wales, Florida, US; it contains large collections of carillon music and related materials.\\nIn the late 2010s, University of Michigan professor Tiffany Ng analyzed the diversity of the carillon repertoire. In a bibliography focusing on African-American music and composers, Ng claims, \"while African-American music permeates the carillon repertoire,\" mostly in the form of spirituals, \"almost none of the carillon arrangements and compositions are authored by African Americans.\" In a second bibliography with Emmet Lewis focusing on women, transgender, and non-binary composers, they assert that while many works have been written by these groups, they are often not published through traditional means, and \"gender inequality remains systemic and common practice in carillon concerts.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Performances ===\\n\\nPerformances on the carillon are commonly categorized as either recitals or concerts. Carillon recitals are traditional performances that take place on fixed schedules throughout the week. They may supplement regularly scheduled events, or take place at the convenience of the carillonneur. Traditional since the instrument\\'s inception, this method is the foundation of carillon performance. Concerts refer to special carillon performances, typically featuring a program and a place for the audience to sit and listen. Some carillonneurs may livestream the event so the audience can watch them at the keyboard. The first carillon concert was held on 1 August 1892 as part of Jef Denyn\\'s Monday-evening concert series.\\nThe lack of consistent interest in traditional performances among the general public has caused carillonneurs to engage in musical collaborations and experiments, collectively referred to as \"Carillon Plus\". Carillonneur duos explore the possibility of duet playing and producing new music for the configuration. Others seek to play the carillon in orchestras, bands, and other ensembles. Carillon Plus performances are not new, but have been explored more intensely since the mid-20th century.\\n\\n\\n== Organization and education ==\\nThe World Carillon Federation is the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of pre-existing regional, national, and supranational carillon organizations. As of 2025, it is composed of 15 member organizations:\\n\\nEvery three years, the federation hosts an international congress in a home country of one of the member organizations. The congresses host lectures, workshops, and committee meetings about the topics related to the carillon, for example: news, tutorials and demonstrations, and research developments. Most member organizations give periodic updates to their members on the state of carillon culture in their respective regions.\\n\\nTraining to perform on a carillon can be obtained at several institutions, though the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\" has been the most popular. The LUCA School of Arts in Leuven, Belgium, offers a master\\'s degree in the carillon, and the Utrecht School of the Arts in Amersfoort, Netherlands, has a dedicated school. The Scandinavian Carillon School is located in Denmark, and there are schools in the United Kingdom and France.\\nThe Guild of Carillonneurs in North America organizes carillon examinations during its annual congresses. Those who pass are certified as carillonneur-members of the guild. It also partners with the North American Carillon School, founded in 2012 as an affiliate of the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\". Several American universities offer a carillon program within their curriculum. For example, the University of California, Berkeley; the University of California, Santa Barbara; the University of Denver; the University of Florida; and the University of Michigan offer complete courses of study. Clemson University, Indiana University, Iowa State University, the University of Kansas, and Marquette University offer limited credit for carillon performance. Employed carillonneurs will often offer private lessons at their carillons. Universities that possess a carillon but do not offer course credit often have a student organization or education program, such as the Yale Guild of Carillonneurs, which manages performances on the Yale Memorial Carillon, and the University of Chicago Guild of Carillonists.\\nMusic competitions for carillon are held regularly, with the international Queen Fabiola Competition being the most important.\\n\\n\\n== Distribution ==\\n\\nSeveral institutions register and count carillons worldwide. Some registries specialize in counting specific types of carillons. For example, the War Memorial and Peace Carillons registry counts instruments that serve as war memorials or were built in the name of promoting world peace. TowerBells counts carillons played via a baton keyboard as \"traditional carillons\" and those with computerized or electronic mechanisms as \"non-traditional carillons\", among other bell instruments. It also publishes maps, technical specifications, and summary statistics. As the World Carillon Federation does not consider non-traditional carillons to be carillons, it counts only those which are played via a baton keyboard and without computerized or electronic mechanisms.\\nAccording to TowerBells and the World Carillon Federation,  about 700 traditional carillons exist. At least three can be found on every continent except Antarctica; however, of the countries in which traditional carillons can be found, only six have more than 20. The \"great carillon\" countries—the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United States—account for two-thirds of the world total. Over 90% are in either Western Europe (mainly the Low Countries) or North America. In North America, about 80% of carillons are owned by religious or educational institutions, while in Europe, nearly all carillons are municipally owned. Almost all extant traditional carillons were constructed in the last 100 years; only some 50 historical carillons from the 18th century or earlier still exist. According to TowerBells, there are another 483 non-traditional carillons, which are located mainly in the United States and Western Europe.\\n\\n\\n== Traveling carillons ==\\n\\nTraveling or mobile carillons are those which are not housed in a tower. Instead, the bells and playing console are installed on a frame that allows it to be transported. These carillons have to be much lighter than their non-mobile counterparts. Nora Johnston conceived the idea of a traveling carillon between 1933 and 1938. She connected a traditional baton keyboard to a system of chime bars and fixed the structure to a portable frame. Johnston traveled twice to the United States to perform in radio documentaries, orchestral concerts, and commercials. Subsequent constructions by others used actual carillon bells.\\nAccording to counts by the World Carillon Federation and TowerBells, there are about 20 existing traveling carillons with only three being non-traditional. Many were or are owned by bell foundries as a promotional tool. Almost all traveling carillons are headquartered in Western Europe and the United States. Two American traveling carillons are part of the musical group Cast in Bronze, which features the \"Spirit of the Bells\" playing the carillon in concert with other instruments or a recording. Cast in Bronze is credited with introducing the carillon to the United States\\' public in its mission to promote and preserve the instrument.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nBianzhong, an Eastern instrument having clapperless bells that are struck with hammers\\nCanpanò – Italian bell ringing\\nElectronic carillon\\nFull circle ringing\\nBolognese bell ringing\\nChange ringing\\nVeronese bell ringing\\nRussian Orthodox bell ringing\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nEnglish-speaking carillon organizations\\nWorld Carillon Federation\\nCarillon Society of Britain and Ireland\\nCarillon Society of Australia\\nThe Guild of Carillonneurs in North America\\nNorth American Carillon School\\nShort educational video about the carillon from the World Carillon Federation\\nShort video tutorial on composing for the carillon\\nTutorial website on arranging for the carillon\\nMuseum Klok en Peel (Carillon museum in the Netherlands)', type='ToolCallSummaryMessage', tool_calls=[FunctionCall(id='call_7S0Zd5Q3XiRWDEu7PpB6iaYx', arguments='{\"title\":\"Carillon\"}', name='get_wikipedia_page')], results=[FunctionExecutionResult(content='A carillon (US:  KARR-ə-lon, UK:  kə-RIL-yən) is a pitched percussion instrument that is played with a keyboard and consists of at least 23 bells. The bells are cast in bronze, hung in fixed suspension, and tuned in chromatic order so that they can be sounded harmoniously together. They are struck with clappers connected to a keyboard of wooden batons played with the hands and pedals played with the feet. Often housed in bell towers, carillons are usually owned by churches, universities, or municipalities. They can include an automatic system through which the time is announced and simple tunes are played throughout the day.\\nCarillons come in many designs, weights, sizes, and sounds. They are among the world\\'s heaviest instruments, and the heaviest carillon weighs over 91 metric tons (100 short tons). Most weigh between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons). To be considered a carillon, a minimum of 23 bells is needed; otherwise, it is called a chime. Standard-sized instruments have about 50, and the world\\'s largest has 77 bells. The appearance of  carillons depends on the number and weight of the bells and the tower in which they are housed. They may be found in towers that are free-standing or connected to a building. The bells of a carillon may be directly exposed to the elements or hidden inside the structure of their towers.\\nThe origins of the carillon can be traced to the Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—in the 16th century. The modern carillon was invented in 1644 when Jacob van Eyck and the Hemony brothers cast the first tuned carillon. The instrument experienced a peak until the late 18th century, a decline during the French Revolution, a revival in the late 19th century, a second decline during the First and Second World Wars, and a second revival thereafter. UNESCO has designated 56 belfries in Belgium and France as a World Heritage Site and recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage.\\nAccording to counts by various registries, about 700 carillons exist worldwide. Most are in and around the Low Countries, though nearly 200 have been constructed in North America. Almost all extant carillons were constructed in the 20th century. Additionally, about 500 \"non-traditional\" carillons are known that most registries do not consider to be carillons due to some component of their action being electrified or computerized. A plurality of them is located in the United States, and most of the others are in Western Europe. A few \"traveling\" or \"mobile\" carillons are fixed to a frame that enables them to be transported.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology and terminology ==\\nThe word carillon is a loanword from French dating to the late 18th century. It is derived from Old French carignon (an alteration of quarregon) \\'a set of four bells\\'. The word quarregon originates from Latin quaternionem \\'set of four\\'; from quater \\'four times\\'. The word carillon is often stated to have referred originally to a set of four forestrike bells, whose melodies announced the time signal of public hour bells, but this is not confirmed by archival sources. Some convincing evidence shows that the term referred initially to the medieval custom of chiming on sets of four church bells by pulling the clappers by means of ropes. In German, as well as using the French term, a carillon is sometimes called a Glockenspiel (lit.\\u2009\\'bells set\\'). This should not be confused with the identically named glockenspiel, which itself is sometimes called a carillon in French. Dutch speakers use the word beiaard, which has an uncertain etymology.\\nA musician who plays the carillon is commonly called a carillonneur (US:  KERR-ə-lə-NUR, UK:  kə-RIL-yə-NUR), also lent from French. It and carillon were adopted by English speakers after the introduction of the instrument to British troops following the War of the Spanish Succession in the 18th century. Though the French word carillonneur literally refers to carillon players who are men, the French carillonneuse to denote women is not used in English. Another common term is the English carillonist, which some players of the carillon have wished to replace carillonneur because of the former\\'s gender inclusivity, simple spelling, and unambiguous pronunciation. In 2018, the World Carillon Federation adopted carillonist as the preferred term for its communications.\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\n\\n=== Construction ===\\n\\nThe carillon is a keyboard instrument. Though it shares similarities with other instruments in this category, such as the organ or pedal piano, its playing console is unique. Playing is done with the player\\'s hands on a manual keyboard composed of rounded, wooden batons. The manual has short chromatic keys (i.e. \"black keys\") raised above the diatonic keys (\"white keys\") and arranged like a piano, but they are spaced far apart, and the chromatic keys are raised above the rest, about 10 cm (4 in). To operate, the keys are depressed with a closed fist. The lowest one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half octaves of the manual are connected to a pedal keyboard played with the feet. The connection is direct, meaning that when a pedal is pressed, its corresponding key on the manual is pulled down with it. Since the mid-20th century, two keyboard design standards have competed for a carillon\\'s console: the North American standard and the North European standard. They differ over several design elements, such as whether the outer pedals curve toward the center or the specific distance a key is depressed. In 2006, the World Carillon Federation developed the WCF Keyboard 2006, which is a compromise between the two standards. The organization recommends that its keyboard standard be used as a guideline when constructing new carillons or renovating existing keyboards.\\n\\nEach key is connected to a transmission system by a wire, usually made of stainless steel. When a particular key is depressed, it pulls on the wire, which after interacting with other wires and pulleys, causes a clapper to swing towards the inner wall of the key\\'s corresponding bell. At rest, these clappers are about 2 to 4 cm (0.8 to 1.6 in) away from the bell wall. Small bells are fitted with springs to pull their clappers back immediately after the stroke, so that the bell is not sounded more than once with each keystroke. This is not necessary for large bells, which have sufficiently heavy clappers. Immediately above each key is a wire adjuster called a turnbuckle. These allow the performer to adjust the length of the wire, which often changes with temperature fluctuations.\\nThe carillon\\'s cast-bronze, cup-shaped bells are housed at the top of a tower in a structure typically made of steel or wooden beams. The arrangement of the bells depends on the space, height, and construction of the tower, and the number and size of bells. When the heaviest bells are especially large, they are usually placed below the playing cabin to achieve a better tonal distribution. The bells do not move during operation, only the clappers. With some instruments, the heaviest bells may be outfitted with a mechanism enabling them to swing.\\n\\n\\n=== Mechanization with clock and playing drum ===\\n\\nCarillons may also feature an automatic mechanism by which simple tunes or the Westminster Quarters are played on the lower bells. The mechanism on European carillons is often a playing drum, which is a large metal cylinder connected to a clock mechanism. Metal pegs are screwed onto the outside of the drum. When the clock mechanism sets the drum in motion, the pegs catch onto levers, connected to hammers that rest just a short distance from the outside of the bell. The hammers are briefly raised, and then fall onto the bell as the peg continues to rotate away from the lever. The pegs are arranged such that simple tunes can be programmed to play at specific quarter hours. In North America, automatic-playing drum systems are not common; instead, carillons may have pneumatic systems, which ring the instrument.\\n\\n\\n=== Sound ===\\n\\nCarillons produce sound by striking stationary bells, categorizing them as percussion idiophones in the Hornbostel–Sachs classification of musical instruments (111.242.222 – sets of bells with internal strikers). Carillon bells are made of bell bronze, a specialized copper–tin alloy used for its above-average rigidity and resonance. A bell\\'s profile (shape) and weight determine its note and the quality of its tone. Therefore, apart from changes in its profile, such as chipping or corrosion, a bell will never lose its original sound. It produces a sound with overtones, also known as partial tones, which are not necessarily harmonically related. To produce a pleasing, harmonically related series of tones, the bell\\'s profile must be carefully adjusted. Bellfounders typically focus on five principal tones when tuning, most notably the minor third overtone called the tierce, which gives rise to the unique sound of carillons and has been the subject of further research, such as the major third bell. Since the casting process does not reliably produce perfectly tuned bells, they are cast slightly thicker and metal is shaved off with a lathe. On older European carillons, bells were tuned with each other using the meantone temperament tuning system. Modern carillons, particularly those in North America, are tuned to equal temperament.\\n\\nThe carillon has a dynamic range similar to a piano, if not more versatile. Through variation of touch, performers can express many volumes. The larger the bell, the larger its dynamic range. Bigger bells will also sound naturally louder than smaller, higher-pitched bells.\\nAlong with pipe organs, carillons are among the world\\'s heaviest musical instruments. Most carillons weigh (counting only the weight of the bells) between 4.5 and 15 metric tons (5.0 and 16.5 short tons), with extremes ranging from very light 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) instruments to the world\\'s heaviest at over 91 metric tons (100 short tons)—the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon of the Riverside Church in New York City, US. Its bourdon, or largest bell, is the largest tuned bell ever cast for a carillon. It sounds a full octave below most other bourdons. The entire ensemble of fixed and swinging bells, clappers, and steel framework weighs more than 226 metric tons (249 short tons).\\n\\n\\n=== Range ===\\nA carillon\\'s range is determined by the number of bells it has, which usually depends on funds available for the creation of the instrument; more money allows more bells to be cast, especially the larger, more costly ones. A carillon, as generally accepted, must have a minimum of 23 bells, or else it is called a chime. No standard pitch range for the carillon has been established, so several subcategories are used to categorize them:\\n\\nCarillons with 23 to 27 bells and 35 to 39 bells are classified as two-octave and three-octave carillons, respectively. Players of these instruments often use music written specifically for the limited ranges.\\nA \"concert\" or \"standard\" carillon typically has 45 to 50 bells, or a range of about four octaves.\\nCarillons with more than 50 bells are often referred to as \"great\" or \"grand\" carillons.\\nCarillons of 15 to 22 bells, which were built before 1940, may be classified as \"historical carillons\" by the World Carillon Federation.\\n\\nThe title of \"world\\'s largest carillon by number of bells\" is shared between two instruments: the carillon of the Kirk in the Hills Presbyterian Church in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, US, and the carillon at the Daejeon Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea; both have 77 bells.\\nSince a carillon is seldom played in concert with other instruments, its bourdon may be any pitch—whichever is advantageous for the location and funds available; to simplify the writing and playing of music, keyboards often have a C-compass. As a result, many carillons are transposing instruments, especially those that are small, have many bells, or were constructed on limited funds. The transposition can vary from down a perfect fourth to up an octave. In North America, increasing numbers of new carillons have been installed in concert pitch as a result of the desire to establish the carillon as a full-fledged concert instrument.\\nMany carillons, according to a C-compass, are missing the lowest C♯ and E♭ bells (equating to the second- and fourth-largest bells if they were included). The reason is often financial; by omitting these bells, the construction of a carillon can be reduced significantly, sometimes by 20% for large installations. Since the early 1900s, European installations often reintroduce the E♭ bell, and instead of adding the C♯ bell, they include a B♭ bell (which is a major second below the C-compass bell).\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Origins ===\\nThe carillon originated from two earlier functions of bells: ringing bells to send messages or to indicate the time of day.\\nBellringers attached ropes to the clappers of swinging bells and rang them while stationary in a technique called chiming. Chiming bells gave the ringer more control compared to swinging bells, so was used to send messages to those within earshot. For example, sounding bells was often used to warn of a fire or impending attack. At celebratory events, a bellringer could gather ropes together to chime multiple bells in rhythmic patterns. By the end of the 15th century, chimers are recorded to have used their technique to play music on bells. A 1478 chronicle recounts a man in Dunkirk having made a \"great innovation in honor of God\" by playing melodies on bells. Another one recounts in 1482 a jester from Aalst playing bells in Antwerp with ropes and batons, the latter term suggesting the existence of a keyboard.\\n\\nIn the 14th century, the newly developed escapement technology for mechanical clocks spread throughout European clock towers and gradually replaced the water clock. Since the earliest clocks lacked faces, they announced the time by striking a bell a number of times corresponding to the hour. Eventually, these striking clocks were modified to make a warning signal just before the hour count to draw the attention of listeners to the upcoming announcement. This signal is called the forestrike (Dutch: voorslag). Originally, the forestrike consisted of striking one or two bells, and the systems slowly grew in complexity. By the middle of the 15th century, forestrikes, with three to seven bells, could play simple melodies.\\nAs late as 1510, these two functions were combined into one primitive carillon in the Oudenaarde Town Hall. One set of nine bells was connected to both a keyboard and the clock\\'s forestrike. The Low Countries—present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and the French Netherlands—were most interested in the potential of using bells to make music. In this region, bellfounding had reached an advanced stage relative to other regions in Europe.\\n\\n\\n=== Development ===\\nThe new instrument developed in the favorable conditions in the Low Countries during the 17th century. Bellfounders found increased financial and technological support as the region traded by sea through ports. Moreover, the political situation under Margaret of Austria and Holy Roman emperor Charles V brought relative wealth and power to cities. Carillons quickly became a fashionable symbol of civic prestige. Cities and towns competed against one another to possess the largest, highest-quality instruments. The demand was met by a successful industry of bellfounding families, notably the Waghevens and Vanden Gheyns. Together, they produced over 50 carillons during the 16th and early 17th centuries. By 1600, the primitive carillon had become an established feature of the region.\\n\\nA critical development for the modern carillon occurred in the 17th century, which involved a partnership between Pieter and François Hemony and Jacob van Eyck. The Hemony brothers were prominent bellfounders known for their precise tuning technique. Van Eyck was a renowned blind carillonneur of Utrecht, who was commissioned by several Dutch cities to maintain and make improvements to their clock chimes and carillons. He was particularly interested in the sounds of bells. In 1633, he developed the ability to isolate and describe a bell\\'s five main overtones and discovered a bell\\'s partial tones can be tuned harmoniously with each other by adjusting the bell\\'s thickness. The Hemony brothers were commissioned in 1644 to cast 19 bells for Zutphen\\'s Wijnhuistoren with Van Eyck as their consultant. By tuning the bells with the advice from Van Eyck, they created the first carillon by the modern definition. According to carillonneur John Gouwens, the quality of the bells was so impressive that Van Eyck recommended casting a full two octaves, or 23 bells. This range has been considered the standard minimum range for carillons ever since. During the next 36 years, the Hemony brothers produced 51 carillons. Carillon culture experienced a peak around this time and until the late-18th century.\\n\\n\\n=== Decline ===\\nThe French Revolution had far-reaching consequences on the Low Countries and the carillon. France conquered and annexed the Austrian Netherlands in 1795 and the United Provinces in 1810. After publishing instructions for extracting copper from bell bronze, France sought to dismantle local carillons to reduce its copper shortage. Carillon owners resisted, for example, by petitioning the new governments to declare their instruments as \"culturally significant\" or by disconnecting the bells and burying them in secret. During this period, as many as 110 carillons existed. About 50 of them were destroyed as a result of war, fire, and dismantling. The majority were melted down to produce cannons for the French Revolutionary Wars.\\nBetween 1750 and the end of the 19th century, interest in the carillon declined greatly. An increasing number of households had access to grandfather clocks and pocket watches, which eroded the carillon\\'s monopoly on announcing the time. As a musical instrument, the carillon lagged behind during the Romantic era, which featured music of a wandering, story-like nature. Many carillons were tuned using meantone temperament, which meant they were not suited for the chromaticism of the newer musical styles. The production of new musical works for the instrument essentially came to a standstill. The standard skill level of carillonneurs had also dropped significantly, so much so that in 1895, the music publisher Schott frères issued Matthias Vanden Gheyn\\'s 11 carillon preludes for piano with a foreword claiming \"no carillonneur of our time knows how to play them on the carillon\". Also, with a reduced demand for new carillons, the tuning techniques developed by the Hemony brothers, but not Van Eyck\\'s underlying theory, were forgotten. Subsequent carillons were generally inferior to earlier installations.\\n\\n\\n=== Revival ===\\nIn the early 1890s, an English change ringer and canon Arthur Simpson published a set of articles on bell tuning, where he argued bell founders had been complacent with their poor tuning methods and proposed solutions to the existing problems. John William Taylor, who had been trying to replicate the tuning techniques of the Hemony brothers and the Vanden Gheyns at his foundry, began working with Simpson. In 1904, they founded the first tuned bells in over a century. The rediscovery initiated a revival of carillon building.\\nIn Mechelen, Belgium, Jef Denyn was a major figure in the carillon\\'s revival as a musical instrument. In 1887, after his father had become completely blind, Denyn took over as the city carillonneur and was responsible for playing the carillon in the tower of St. Rumbold\\'s Cathedral. From the beginning of his career, Denyn advocated for better playability of the instrument. He further developed the tumbler rack system of transmission cables that his father had installed on the cathedral carillon. This allowed the player to have better control over dynamic variations, fast musical passages, and tremolos. Tremolos offered a solution to a Romantic-era limitation of the carillon: its inability to expressively sustain the sound of individual notes.\\n\\nWith his improving skills as a carillonneur and the upgraded cathedral carillon, Denyn\\'s performances began attracting crowds of listeners. He established regular Monday-night concerts at the suggestion of the city council. On 1 August 1892, Denyn hosted the first carillon concert in history. From this point forward, the instrument garnered a reputation as a concert instrument, rather than as an instrument tasked with providing background music.\\n\\n\\n=== Impact of the World Wars ===\\nBecause of his concerts, Denyn met William Gorham Rice, an American state and federal government official from Albany, New York, US. Having traveled to The Hague and been exposed to the carillon, Rice was regularly touring the region to interview carillonneurs for his research. After Denyn\\'s 18 August 1913 evening concert, he and Rice exchanged ideas about the societal and educational value of carillon performances for large audiences. Rice\\'s book Carillons of Belgium and Holland, the first in the English language written specifically about carillons, was published in December 1914 and reprinted three times. The book painted an idealized picture of the region that resonated with the American public, particularly in light of the rape of Belgium. Its success motivated Rice to publish two more books in 1915 and 1925. Rice became an authority on carillons in the United States; besides his books, he gave 35 lectures in several cities, published articles in magazines, spoke on radio programs, and presented exhibition material on the subject between 1912 and 1922. In 1922, Rice garnered financial support from Herbert Hoover and John D. Rockefeller Jr. to establish a carillon school in Mechelen, with Denyn as its first director. It was later named the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\".\\n\\nStephen Thorne of the Canadian military history magazine Legion writes that the Allied Powers of World War I and of World War II saw the destruction of carillons during the respective wars as a \"brutal annihilation of a unique democratic music instrument\". The destruction was highly publicized among the allies of Belgium and the Netherlands. In the latter war, British investigators claimed Germany seized two-thirds of all bells in Belgium and every bell in the Netherlands. Between 1938 and 1945, 175,000 bells were stolen and stored in \"bell cemeteries\" (German: Glockenfriedhöfe). Some 150,000 were sent to foundries and melted down for their copper. Following the war, with the bells out of their towers, E. W. Van Heuven and other physicists could research the tonal qualities of bells in laboratory conditions and with modern electrical sound-analyzing equipment. Percival Price, the Dominion carillonneur at the Peace Tower, was tasked with repatriating as many surviving bells as possible. He also used the opportunity to publish similar research. Every bellfounder could then learn how to cast the highest-quality bells, and the increase in new carillons was greater than ever.\\n\\n\\n=== Movement in North America ===\\nBetween 1922 and 1940, bellfounders installed 43 carillons in the United States and Canada. The flood of carillons onto the continent is attributed to Rice\\'s widely popular books and persistent education in the United States. His romanticized depiction of the cultural instrument prompted wealthy donors to purchase carillons for their own civil and religious communities. Price was appointed to play the carillon at the Metropolitan United Church in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (before working as the Dominion carillonneur); Mary Mesquita Dahlmer was appointed to play at Our Lady of Good Voyage Church in Gloucester, Massachusetts, US. Both were the first professional carillonneurs in their respective countries. In 1936, The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America was founded at Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Following the deaths of Denyn in 1941 and Rice in 1945, North American carillonneurs, through their new organization, sought to develop their own authority on education and performance. In the 1950s and 1960s, a distinct North American style of carillon music emerged at the University of Kansas. Ronald Barnes, the university\\'s carillonneur, led in the style and encouraged his peers to compose for the carillon, and produced many of his own compositions.\\n\\n\\n=== International recognition ===\\nIn the 1970s, the idea for a global carillon organization took shape, and the World Carillon Federation was later formed as the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of the pre-existing national or regional carillon associations that had been founded throughout the 20th century.\\nIn 1999, UNESCO designated 32 bell towers in Belgium as a World Heritage Site, in recognition of their architectural diversity and significance. The list was expanded in 2005 to include 23 in France, as well as the tower of Gembloux, Belgium. In 2014, UNESCO recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as an intangible cultural heritage, stating that it \"recognizes the creativity of carillonneurs and others who ensure that this cultural form remains relevant to today\\'s local societies.\"\\nIn 2008, the carillon was featured in the film Welcome to the Sticks, a box-office success as the highest-grossing French film ever released in France as of 2021.\\nIn 2019, playing the carillon of St. Coleman\\'s Cathedral in Cobh, Ireland, was recognized by the Irish government as key element of the country\\'s living cultural heritage. In 2025, the casting of bells and playing music on bells was added to Germany\\'s list of intangible cultural heritage.\\n\\n\\n== Usage and repertoire ==\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n\\nThe carillon repertoire skews heavily toward newer works in stark contrast to that of its relative, the organ repertoire. Some 15 collections of carillon music written in the 17th and 18th centuries are known to exist. Like with the pipe organ, early carillon performances consisted mostly of improvisations. In the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, keyboard music was not written for one instrument or another, but rather was written to be played on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the carillon\\'s repertoire in its early history was likely the same as that of the harpsichord, organ, and piano. One of the few surviving examples is the De Gruytters carillon book, dated 1746. The music is arranged,rather than composed, for performance on the carillon and could easily be played on other keyboard instruments. Baroque keyboard music is well suited for carillon transcription, particularly the works of Bach, Corelli, Couperin, Handel, Mozart, and Vivaldi.\\n\\nThe earliest known original compositions specifically for the carillon, and not simply any keyboard, are the 11 preludes of Matthias Vanden Gheyn. The structure of his works suggests he had been playing nonspecific keyboard music on the carillon for many years and that he wanted to play music that is idiomatic to the instrument. Technically challenging, his preludes have been the standard repertoire among carillonneurs since the early 1900s.\\nJef Denyn made many public statements about what music should be performed on the carillon, and he persuaded several composers of the time to write for it. Among those composers were his students, including Staf Nees, Léon Henry, and Jef Rottiers, and composers for other instruments, such as Jef van Hoof. The carillon school began publishing carillon music in 1925. Through his school, Denyn was the early proponent of the \"Mechelen style\" of carillon music, which consists of virtuosic flourishes, tremolos, and other Baroque and Romantic elements.\\nRonald Barnes was the leading figure behind the North American style of carillon music, which developed in the 1950s and 1960s. He encouraged his University of Kansas peers to compose for the carillon, and he produced many of his own compositions. Barnes\\' campaign was most successful with Roy Hamlin Johnson, a piano professor who introduced a whole category of music exclusively native to the carillon featuring the octatonic scale. Many of Johnson\\'s works are acknowledged as masterpieces. Barnes produced 56 original compositions and hundreds of arrangements to expand the available repertoire. Other major 20th-century contributors were Albert Gerken, Gary C. White, Johan Franco, John Pozdro, and Jean W. Miller. The new American style developed into the antithesis of the Mechelen style; instead of exciting, tremolo-filled performances that demonstrate the showmanship of the carillonneur, it features slow passages, sparse harmonies, and impressionist themes to draw the listener\\'s attention to the natural sound of the bells.\\n\\nCarillon music was first published in North America in 1934. G. Schirmer, Inc. published the compositions of Curtis Institute of Music students Samuel Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, and Nino Rota as part of the institute\\'s short-lived publishing series. The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America opened the first dedicated publishing house for carillon music in North America in 1961. In 1968, the Anton Brees Carillon Library was established at Bok Tower Gardens in Lake Wales, Florida, US; it contains large collections of carillon music and related materials.\\nIn the late 2010s, University of Michigan professor Tiffany Ng analyzed the diversity of the carillon repertoire. In a bibliography focusing on African-American music and composers, Ng claims, \"while African-American music permeates the carillon repertoire,\" mostly in the form of spirituals, \"almost none of the carillon arrangements and compositions are authored by African Americans.\" In a second bibliography with Emmet Lewis focusing on women, transgender, and non-binary composers, they assert that while many works have been written by these groups, they are often not published through traditional means, and \"gender inequality remains systemic and common practice in carillon concerts.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Performances ===\\n\\nPerformances on the carillon are commonly categorized as either recitals or concerts. Carillon recitals are traditional performances that take place on fixed schedules throughout the week. They may supplement regularly scheduled events, or take place at the convenience of the carillonneur. Traditional since the instrument\\'s inception, this method is the foundation of carillon performance. Concerts refer to special carillon performances, typically featuring a program and a place for the audience to sit and listen. Some carillonneurs may livestream the event so the audience can watch them at the keyboard. The first carillon concert was held on 1 August 1892 as part of Jef Denyn\\'s Monday-evening concert series.\\nThe lack of consistent interest in traditional performances among the general public has caused carillonneurs to engage in musical collaborations and experiments, collectively referred to as \"Carillon Plus\". Carillonneur duos explore the possibility of duet playing and producing new music for the configuration. Others seek to play the carillon in orchestras, bands, and other ensembles. Carillon Plus performances are not new, but have been explored more intensely since the mid-20th century.\\n\\n\\n== Organization and education ==\\nThe World Carillon Federation is the central organization of carillon players and enthusiasts. It is a federation of pre-existing regional, national, and supranational carillon organizations. As of 2025, it is composed of 15 member organizations:\\n\\nEvery three years, the federation hosts an international congress in a home country of one of the member organizations. The congresses host lectures, workshops, and committee meetings about the topics related to the carillon, for example: news, tutorials and demonstrations, and research developments. Most member organizations give periodic updates to their members on the state of carillon culture in their respective regions.\\n\\nTraining to perform on a carillon can be obtained at several institutions, though the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\" has been the most popular. The LUCA School of Arts in Leuven, Belgium, offers a master\\'s degree in the carillon, and the Utrecht School of the Arts in Amersfoort, Netherlands, has a dedicated school. The Scandinavian Carillon School is located in Denmark, and there are schools in the United Kingdom and France.\\nThe Guild of Carillonneurs in North America organizes carillon examinations during its annual congresses. Those who pass are certified as carillonneur-members of the guild. It also partners with the North American Carillon School, founded in 2012 as an affiliate of the Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\". Several American universities offer a carillon program within their curriculum. For example, the University of California, Berkeley; the University of California, Santa Barbara; the University of Denver; the University of Florida; and the University of Michigan offer complete courses of study. Clemson University, Indiana University, Iowa State University, the University of Kansas, and Marquette University offer limited credit for carillon performance. Employed carillonneurs will often offer private lessons at their carillons. Universities that possess a carillon but do not offer course credit often have a student organization or education program, such as the Yale Guild of Carillonneurs, which manages performances on the Yale Memorial Carillon, and the University of Chicago Guild of Carillonists.\\nMusic competitions for carillon are held regularly, with the international Queen Fabiola Competition being the most important.\\n\\n\\n== Distribution ==\\n\\nSeveral institutions register and count carillons worldwide. Some registries specialize in counting specific types of carillons. For example, the War Memorial and Peace Carillons registry counts instruments that serve as war memorials or were built in the name of promoting world peace. TowerBells counts carillons played via a baton keyboard as \"traditional carillons\" and those with computerized or electronic mechanisms as \"non-traditional carillons\", among other bell instruments. It also publishes maps, technical specifications, and summary statistics. As the World Carillon Federation does not consider non-traditional carillons to be carillons, it counts only those which are played via a baton keyboard and without computerized or electronic mechanisms.\\nAccording to TowerBells and the World Carillon Federation,  about 700 traditional carillons exist. At least three can be found on every continent except Antarctica; however, of the countries in which traditional carillons can be found, only six have more than 20. The \"great carillon\" countries—the Netherlands, Belgium, and the United States—account for two-thirds of the world total. Over 90% are in either Western Europe (mainly the Low Countries) or North America. In North America, about 80% of carillons are owned by religious or educational institutions, while in Europe, nearly all carillons are municipally owned. Almost all extant traditional carillons were constructed in the last 100 years; only some 50 historical carillons from the 18th century or earlier still exist. According to TowerBells, there are another 483 non-traditional carillons, which are located mainly in the United States and Western Europe.\\n\\n\\n== Traveling carillons ==\\n\\nTraveling or mobile carillons are those which are not housed in a tower. Instead, the bells and playing console are installed on a frame that allows it to be transported. These carillons have to be much lighter than their non-mobile counterparts. Nora Johnston conceived the idea of a traveling carillon between 1933 and 1938. She connected a traditional baton keyboard to a system of chime bars and fixed the structure to a portable frame. Johnston traveled twice to the United States to perform in radio documentaries, orchestral concerts, and commercials. Subsequent constructions by others used actual carillon bells.\\nAccording to counts by the World Carillon Federation and TowerBells, there are about 20 existing traveling carillons with only three being non-traditional. Many were or are owned by bell foundries as a promotional tool. Almost all traveling carillons are headquartered in Western Europe and the United States. Two American traveling carillons are part of the musical group Cast in Bronze, which features the \"Spirit of the Bells\" playing the carillon in concert with other instruments or a recording. Cast in Bronze is credited with introducing the carillon to the United States\\' public in its mission to promote and preserve the instrument.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nBianzhong, an Eastern instrument having clapperless bells that are struck with hammers\\nCanpanò – Italian bell ringing\\nElectronic carillon\\nFull circle ringing\\nBolognese bell ringing\\nChange ringing\\nVeronese bell ringing\\nRussian Orthodox bell ringing\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nEnglish-speaking carillon organizations\\nWorld Carillon Federation\\nCarillon Society of Britain and Ireland\\nCarillon Society of Australia\\nThe Guild of Carillonneurs in North America\\nNorth American Carillon School\\nShort educational video about the carillon from the World Carillon Federation\\nShort video tutorial on composing for the carillon\\nTutorial website on arranging for the carillon\\nMuseum Klok en Peel (Carillon museum in the Netherlands)', name='get_wikipedia_page', call_id='call_7S0Zd5Q3XiRWDEu7PpB6iaYx', is_error=False)]), TextMessage(id='be3d12ed-5af3-4238-b7f9-b6f42f8a0e6c', source='timeline_creator', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=8083, completion_tokens=536), metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 23, 16, 0, 23, 798490, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='Here is a timeline of the musical instrument called the carillon, which is a tall tower with bells played from a keyboard:\\n\\n- Late 15th century: Bell ringers used a technique called chiming, playing melodies on bells by pulling ropes attached to stationary bells.\\n- By the middle of the 15th century: Forestrikes with 3 to 7 bells played simple melodies as part of clock towers\\' time announcement.\\n- 1510: One primitive carillon in Oudenaarde Town Hall combined a set of nine bells connected to both a keyboard and the clock\\'s forestrike.\\n- 16th century: The origins of the carillon traced to the Low Countries (present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, and French Netherlands).\\n- 1600: The primitive carillon became an established feature in the region.\\n- 1644: Modern carillon invented when Jacob van Eyck and the Hemony brothers cast the first tuned carillon consisting of 19 bells.\\n- 1644-1680: The Hemony brothers produced 51 carillons, and the standard minimum range for carillons (23 bells) was established.\\n- Late 18th century: Carillon experienced a peak in culture and popularity.\\n- French Revolution (late 18th century-early 19th century): Decline of carillon with many destroyed or melted down.\\n- Late 19th century: Revival of carillon started with improved bell tuning techniques.\\n- 1887: Jef Denyn took over as city carillonneur and improved the carillon\\'s playability.\\n- 1892: First carillon concert was held by Jef Denyn.\\n- Early 20th century: The carillon gained popularity in North America through advocacy by William Gorham Rice.\\n- 1922: Royal Carillon School \"Jef Denyn\" was established in Mechelen, Belgium.\\n- 1922-1940: 43 carillons installed in US and Canada.\\n- World War I & II: Many carillons were destroyed or bells seized and melted down.\\n- Post-War: Research into bell acoustics flourished and carillon building increased.\\n- 1950s-1960s: A distinct North American style of carillon music developed.\\n- 1970s: Formation of the World Carillon Federation as a global organization.\\n- 1999: UNESCO designated 32 bell towers in Belgium as a World Heritage Site.\\n- 2014: UNESCO recognized the carillon culture of Belgium as intangible cultural heritage.\\n\\nThis timeline captures the key historical developments of the carillon as a musical instrument and cultural symbol.\\n\\nTERMINATE', type='TextMessage')], stop_reason=\"Text 'TERMINATE' mentioned\")"
