    "## Introduction\n",

    "In this lab, we will create a task manager using the concept of \"hierarchical planning.\"\n",

    "### Hierarchical Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical planning** is often used in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics to handle tasks that are too complex for a single flat plan. It’s based on *decomposition*: breaking a problem into subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is formalized in systems like Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea**: Instead of searching through every possible action (which could take forever), you define tasks and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **task** is something to do (e.g., \"Travel to Paris\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **method** is a way to do it (e.g., \"Book a flight\" or \"Take a train\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each method can break into smaller tasks, forming a tree-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit**: It reduces computation by focusing only on relevant subtasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# High-level task\n",
    "task TravelToParis:\n",
    "    method1:\n",
    "        - BookFlight(Paris)\n",
    "        - PackBag()\n",
    "    method2:\n",
    "        - BookTrain(Paris)\n",
    "        - PackBag()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lower-level task\n",
    "task BookFlight(destination):\n",
    "    - SearchFlights(destination)\n",
    "    - PayForTicket()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \"TravelToParis\" is abstract, and the planner picks a method (flight or train) based on conditions (e.g., cost or time).\n",

    "## Summary: Structured Output Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been updated to use **structured outputs** with Pydantic models instead of manual JSON parsing. This approach provides several key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eliminated JSON Parsing Issues**: No more dealing with markdown-wrapped JSON or parsing errors\n",
    "2. **Type Safety**: Pydantic models provide automatic validation and type checking\n",
    "3. **Cleaner Code**: Agent functions are simpler and more robust\n",
    "4. **Better Error Handling**: Structured outputs provide clear error messages for invalid schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TaskAssignments Model**: Uses individual fields (`task1_assignee`, `task2_assignee`, `task3_assignee`) with a helper method to convert to dictionary format\n",
    "- **TaskDependencies Model**: Similar structure for Challenge 1 dependency tracking\n",
    "- **LLM Integration**: Uses `llm.with_structured_output(Model)` to enforce schema compliance\n",
